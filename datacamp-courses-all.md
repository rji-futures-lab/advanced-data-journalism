## [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2) (4 hours)
In this second Python Data Science Toolbox course, you'll continue to build your Python data science skills. First, you'll learn about iterators, objects you have already encountered in the context of for loops. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools for all data scientists working in Python. You'll end the course by working through a case study in which you'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this course.

### Using iterators in PythonLand
You'll learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with when writing for loops. You'll learn some handy functions that will allow you to effectively work with iterators. And you’ll finish the chapter with a use case that is pertinent to the world of data science and dealing with large amounts of data—in this case, data from Twitter that you will load in chunks using iterators.

### List comprehensions and generators
In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists—and lists of lists—in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python data science toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory, but instead generate on the fly.

## [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1) (3 hours)
It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.

### Writing your own functions
In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1) (3 hours)
After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

### Graphical exploratory data analysis
Before diving into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data.

### Thinking probabilistically-- Discrete variables
Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data.

### Thinking probabilistically-- Continuous variables
It’s time to move onto continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties. At the end of this final chapter, you will be speaking the probabilistic language you need to launch into the inference techniques covered in the sequel to this course.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2) (4 hours)
After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

### Parameter estimation by optimization
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. A probability distribution that describes your data has parameters. So, a major goal of statistical inference is to estimate the values of these parameters, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.

### Bootstrap confidence intervals
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.

### Introduction to hypothesis testing
You now know how to define and estimate parameters given a model. But the question remains: how reasonable is it to observe your data if a model is true? This question is addressed by hypothesis tests. They are the icing on the inference cake. After completing this chapter, you will be able to carefully construct and test hypotheses using hacker statistics.

### Hypothesis test examples
As you saw from the last chapter, hypothesis testing can be a bit tricky. You need to define the null hypothesis, figure out how to simulate it, and define clearly what it means to be "more extreme" in order to compute the p-value. Like any skill, practice makes perfect, and this chapter gives you some good practice with hypothesis tests.

### Putting it all together: a case study
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!

## [Importing Data in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2) (2 hours)
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In the prequel to this course, you learned many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL. In this course, you'll extend this knowledge base by learning to import data from the web and by pulling data from Application Programming Interfaces— APIs—such as the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets.

### Importing data from the Internet
The web is a rich source of data from which you can extract various types of insights and findings. In this chapter, you will learn how to get data from the web, whether it is stored in files or in HTML. You'll also learn the basics of scraping and parsing web data.

## [Importing Data in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-1) (3 hours)
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models, and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In this course, you'll learn the many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL.

### Introduction and flat files
In this chapter, you'll learn how to import data into Python from all types of flat files, which are a simple and prevalent form of data storage. You've previously learned how to use NumPy and pandas—you will learn how to use these packages to import flat files and customize your imports.

## [Merging DataFrames with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/merging-dataframes-with-pandas) (4 hours)
As a data scientist, you'll often find that the data you need is not in a single file. It may be spread across a number of text files, spreadsheets, or databases. You’ll want to be able to import the data you’re interested in as a collection of DataFrames and combine them to answer your central questions. This course is all about the act of combining—or merging—DataFrames, an essential part of any data scientist's toolbox. You'll hone your pandas skills by learning how to organize, reshape, and aggregate multiple datasets to answer your specific questions.

### Preparing data
In this chapter, you'll learn about different techniques you can use to import multiple files into DataFrames. Having imported your data into individual DataFrames, you'll then learn how to share information between DataFrames using their indexes. Understanding how indexes work is essential to merging DataFrames, which you’ll learn later in the course.

## [Cleaning Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python) (4 hours)
A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. It is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose problems in your data, to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, you'll apply all of the techniques you've learned to a case study to clean a real-world Gapminder dataset.

### Exploring your data
Say you've just gotten your hands on a brand new dataset and are itching to start exploring it. But where do you begin, and how can you be sure your dataset is clean? This chapter will introduce you to data cleaning in Python. You'll learn how to explore your data with an eye for diagnosing issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

## [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.

### Clustering for dataset exploration
Learn how to discover the underlying groups (or "clusters") in a dataset.  By the end of this chapter, you'll be clustering companies using their stock market prices, and distinguishing different species by clustering their measurements.

### Decorrelating your data and dimension reduction
Dimension reduction summarizes a dataset using its common occuring patterns.  In this chapter, you'll learn about the most fundamental of dimension reduction techniques, "Principal Component Analysis" ("PCA").  PCA is often used before supervised learning to improve model performance and generalization.  It can also be useful for unsupervised learning.  For example, you'll employ a variant of PCA will allow you to cluster Wikipedia articles by their content!

## [Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-the-experts-school-budgets) (4 hours)
Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. You'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, you'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, you'll do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, you'll have the opportunity to try your own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, you'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.

### Exploring the raw data
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the problem you'll be solving in this course. How do you accurately classify line-items in a school budget based on what that money is being used for? You will explore the raw text and numeric values in the dataset, both quantitatively and visually. And you'll learn how to measure success when trying to predict class labels for each row of the dataset.

### Summarizing your data and visualizing the result

In this chapter, you will learn how to capture key characteristics of individual variables in simple metrics. As a result, it will be easier to understand the distribution of the variables in your data set: Which values are central to, or typical of your data? Is your data widely dispersed, or rather narrowly distributed around some mid point? Are there outliers? What does the overall distribution look like?

## [Manipulating Time Series Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/manipulating-time-series-data-in-python) (4 hours)
In this course you'll learn the basics of manipulating time series data. Time series data are data that are indexed by a sequence of dates or times. You'll learn how to use methods built into Pandas to work with this index. You'll also learn how resample time series to change the frequency. This course will also show you how to calculate rolling and cumulative values for times series. Finally, you'll use all your new skills to build a value-weighted stock index from actual stock data.

### Working with Time Series in Pandas

This chapter lays the foundations to leverage the powerful time series functionality made available by how Pandas represents dates, in particular by the DateTimeIndex. You will learn how to create and manipulate date information and time series, and how to do calculations with time-aware DataFrames to shift your data in time or create period-specific returns.

## [Time Series Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-time-series-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, you'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance.

### Correlation and Autocorrelation
In this chapter you'll be introduced to the ideas of correlation and autocorrelation for time series. Correlation describes the relationship between two time series and autocorrelation describes the relationship of a time series with its past values.

## [Parallel Computing with Dask](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/parallel-computing-with-dask) (4 hours)
Python is now well established as a major platform for data analysis and data science. For many data scientists, the largest limitation of Python is that all data must fit into the resident memory of the available workstation. Further, traditionally, Python has only been able to utilize one CPU. Data scientists constantly ask, "How can I read and process large amounts of data?" and "How can I make use of more computational processing resources?" This course will introduce you to Dask, a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing. With Dask, you will be able to take the Python workflows you currently have and easily scale them up to large datasets on your workstation without the need to migrate to a distributed computing environment.


### Working with Big Data
In this chapter you'll learn how to leverage traditional Python techniques for reading and processing large datasets stored in either a single file or in multiple files. Finally, you'll learn how the Dask library can be used to execute a pipeline of Python functions in parallel with the added goal of being able to process large amounts of data on modest computational resources.
For this course, the data set sizes have been reduced so that the exercises can be completed rapidly. Many of these data sets were originally several Gigabytes in size.

## [Introduction to PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-pyspark) (4 hours)
In this course, you'll learn how to use Spark from Python! Spark is a tool for doing parallel computation with large datasets and it integrates well with Python. PySpark is the Python package that makes the magic happen. You'll use this package to work with data about flights from Portland and Seattle. You'll learn to wrangle this data and build a whole machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not flights will be delayed. Get ready to put some Spark in your Python code and dive into the world of high-performance machine learning!

### Getting to know PySpark
In this chapter, you'll learn how Spark manages data and how can you read and write tables from Python.

## [Case Studies in Statistical Thinking](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-studies-in-statistical-thinking) (4 hours)
Mastery requires practice. Having completed Statistical Thinking I and II, you developed your probabilistic mindset and the hacker stats skills to extract actionable insights from your data. Your foundation is in place, and now it is time practice your craft.

In this course, you will apply your statistical thinking skills, exploratory data analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, to two new real-world data sets. First, you will explore data from the 2013 and 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships, where you will quantify the relative speeds and variability among swimmers. You will then perform a statistical analysis to assess the "current controversy" of the 2013 Worlds in which swimmers claimed that a slight current in the pool was affecting result. Second, you will study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes around the world. Finally, you will analyze the changes in seismicity in the US state of Oklahoma after the practice of high pressure waste water injection at oil extraction sites became commonplace in the last decade. As you work with these data sets, you will take vital steps toward mastery as you cement your existing knowledge and broaden your abilities to use statistics and Python to make sense of your data.

### Statistical seismology and the Parkfield region
Herein, you'll use your statistical thinking skills to study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes. Along the way, you'll learn some basic statistical seismology, including the Gutenberg-Richter law. This exercise exposes two key ideas about data science: 1) As a data scientist, you wander into all sorts of domain specific analyses, which is very exciting. You constantly get to learn. 2) You are sometimes faced with limited data, which is also the case for many of these earthquake studies. You can still make good progress!

## [Python for R Users](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-for-r-users) (5 hours)
Python and R have seen immense growth in popularity in the "Machine Learning Age". They both are high-level languages that are easy to learn and write. The language you use will depend on your background and field of study and work. R is a language made by and for statisticians, whereas Python is a more general purpose programming language. Regardless of the background, there will be times when a particular algorithm is implemented in one language and not the other, a feature is better documented, or simply, the tutorial you found online uses Python instead of R.

In either case, this would require the R user to work in Python to get his/her work done, or try to understand how something is implemented in Python for it to be translated into R. This course helps you cross the R-Python language barrier.

### The Basics
Learn about some of the most important data types (integers, floats, strings, and booleans) and data structures (lists, dictionaries, numpy arrays, and pandas DataFrames) in Python and how they compare to the ones in R.

## [Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-linear-modeling-in-python) (4 hours)
One of the primary goals of any scientist is to find patterns in data and build models to describe, predict, and extract insight from those patterns. The most fundamental of these patterns is a linear relationship between two variables. This course provides an introduction to exploring, quantifying, and modeling linear relationships in data, by demonstrating techniques such as least-squares, linear regression, estimatation, and bootstrap resampling. Here you will apply the most powerful modeling tools in the python data science ecosystem, including scipy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, to build and evaluate linear models. By exploring the concepts and applications of linear models with python, this course serves as both a practical introduction to modeling, and as a foundation for learning more advanced modeling techniques and tools in statistics and machine learning.

### Exploring Linear Trends
We start the course with an initial exploration of linear relationships, including some motivating examples of how linear models are used, and demonstrations of data visualization methods from matplotlib. We then use descriptive statistics to quantify the shape of our data and use correlation to quantify the strength of linear relationships between two variables.

### Building Linear Models
Here we look at the parts that go into building a linear model. Using the concept of a Taylor Series, we focus on the parameters slope and intercept, how they define the model, and how to interpret the them in several applied contexts. We apply a variety of python modules to find the model that best fits the data, by computing the optimal values of slope and intercept, using least-squares, numpy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn.

### Estimating Model Parameters
In our final chapter, we introduce concepts from inferential statistics, and use them to explore how maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrap resampling can be used to estimate linear model parameters. We then apply these methods to make probabilistic statements about our confidence in the model parameters.

## [Introduction to MongoDB in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-using-mongodb-for-data-science-with-python) (4 hours)
MongoDB is a tool to explore data structured as you see fit. As a NoSQL database, it doesn't follow the strict relational format imposed by SQL. By providing capabilities that typically require adding layers to SQL, it collapses complexity. With dynamic schema, you can handle vastly different data together and consolidate analytics. The flexibility of MongoDB empowers you to keep improving and fix issues as your requirements evolve. In this course, you will learn the MongoDB language and apply it to search and analytics. Working with unprocessed data from the official nobelprize.org API, you will explore and answer questions about Nobel Laureates and prizes.

### Flexibly Structured Data
This chapter is about getting a bird's-eye view of the Nobel Prize data's structure. You will relate MongoDB documents, collections, and databases to JSON and Python types. You'll then use filters, operators, and dot notation to explore substructure.

### Aggregation Pipelines: Let the Server Do It For You
You've used projection, sorting, indexing, and limits to speed up data fetching. But there are still annoying performance bottlenecks in your analysis pipelines. You still need to fetch a ton of data. Thus, network bandwidth and downstream processing and memory capacity still impact performance. This chapter is about using MongoDB to perform aggregations for you on the server.

## [Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-time-series-data-in-python) (4 hours)
Time series data is ubiquitous. Whether it be stock market fluctuations, sensor data recording climate change, or activity in the brain, any signal that changes over time can be described as a time series. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful method for leveraging complexity in data in order to generate predictions and insights into the problem one is trying to solve. This course is an intersection between these two worlds of machine learning and time series data, and covers feature engineering, spectograms, and other advanced techniques in order to classify heartbeat sounds and predict stock prices. 

### Time Series and Machine Learning Primer
This chapter is an introduction to the basics of machine learning, time series data, and the intersection between the two.

## [Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python) (5 hours)
Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions.
In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.

### Classification and Regression Trees
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are a set of supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the CART algorithm.

Bagging is an ensemble method involving training the same algorithm many times using different subsets sampled from the training data. In this chapter, you'll understand how bagging can be used to create a tree ensemble. You'll also learn how the random forests algorithm can lead to further ensemble diversity through randomization at the level of each split in the trees forming the ensemble.

## [Predicting Customer Churn in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/predicting-customer-churn-in-python) (4 hours)

Churn is when a customer stops doing business or ends a relationship with a company. It’s a common problem across a variety of industries, from telecommunications to cable TV to SaaS, and a company that can predict churn can take proactive action to retain valuable customers and get ahead of the competition.  This course will provide you a roadmap to create your own customer churn models. You’ll learn how to explore and visualize your data, prepare it for modeling, make predictions using machine learning, and communicate important, actionable insights to stakeholders. By the end of the course, you’ll become comfortable using the pandas library for data analysis and the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

### Interpreting and explaining models
In a business context, it is often important to explain the intuition behind the model you built. Indeed, if the model and its variables do not make sense, the model might not be used. In this chapter you'll learn how to explain the relationship between the variables in the model and the target by means of predictor insight graphs.

## [Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preprocessing-for-machine-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
This course covers the basics of how and when to perform data preprocessing. This essential step in any machine learning project is when you get your data ready for modeling. Between importing and cleaning your data and fitting your machine learning model is when preprocessing comes into play. You'll learn how to standardize your data so that it's in the right form for your model, create new features to best leverage the information in your dataset, and select the best features to improve your model fit. Finally, you'll have some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings ready for modeling.

### Introduction to Data Preprocessing
In this chapter you'll learn exactly what it means to preprocess data. You'll take the first steps in any preprocessing journey, including exploring data types and dealing with missing data.

## [Machine Learning for Finance in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-finance-in-python) (4 hours)
Time series data is all around us; some examples are the weather, human behavioral patterns as consumers and members of society, and financial data. In this course, you'll learn how to calculate technical indicators from historical stock data, and how to create features and targets out of the historical stock data. You'll understand how to prepare our features for linear models, xgboost models, and neural network models. We will then use linear models, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to predict the future price of stocks in the US markets. You will also learn how to evaluate the performance of the various models we train in order to optimize them, so our predictions have enough accuracy to make a stock trading strategy profitable.

### Preparing data and a linear model
In this chapter, we will learn how machine learning can be used in finance.  We will also explore some stock data, and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.  Finally, we will fit our first machine learning model -- a linear model, in order to predict future price changes of stocks.

## [Statistical Simulation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-simulation-in-python) (4 hours)
Simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use the relatively simple idea of random sampling to solve increasingly complex problems. Although they have been around for ages, they have gained in popularity recently due to the rise in computational power and have seen applications in multiple domains including Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Computational Biology and Finance just to name a few. Students will use simulations to generate and analyze data over different probability distributions using the important NumPy package. This course will give students hands-on experience with simulations using simple, real-world applications.

### Basics of randomness & simulation
This chapter gives you the tools required to run a simulation. We'll start with a review of random variables and probability distributions. We will then learn how to run a simulation by first looking at a simulation workflow and then recreating it in the context of a game of dice. Finally, we will learn how to use simulations for making decisions.

### Formatting raw data, managing dates and financial periods
We have gotten a basic understanding of income statements and balance sheets. However, consolidating data for forecasting is complex, so in this chapter, we will look at some basic tools to help solve some of the complexities specifically relating to finance - working with dates and different financial periods, and formatting our raw data into the correct format for financial forecasting.

### Assumptions and variances in forecasts
In this chapter, we will be exploring two more aspects to creating a good forecast. First, we will look at assumptions, what drives them and what happens when an assumption changes? Next, we will look at variances, as a forecast is built at one point in time, but what happens when the actual results do not correspond to our forecast? We need to build a sensitive forecast that can be sensitive to changes in both assumptions and take into account variances, and this is what we will explore in this chapter.

### Dictionaries and pandas
This chapter introduces some powerful Python data structures: the dictionary and the pandas DataFrame. You will learn to create dictionaries by setting key-value pairs, and view then how to view and modify your dictionary. Then you will be introduced to one of the most important packages in the Pythonista's toolbox, pandas. Specifically, you'll focus on the pandas' structure, the DataFrame, which organizes tabular data in an easily accessible way. Lastly, you'll learn how to transform different data types into DataFrames to make your data easier to work with.

## [Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
One of the most important tasks of a data scientist is to understand the relationships between their data's physical location and their geographical context. In this course you'll be learning to make attractive visualizations of geospatial data with the GeoPandas package. You will learn to spatially join datasets, linking data to context. Finally you will learn to overlay geospatial data to maps to add even more spatial cues to your work. You will use several datasets from the City of Nashville's open data portal to find out where the chickens are in Nashville, which neighborhood has the most public art, and more!

### Building 2-layer maps : combining polygons and scatterplots
In this chapter, you will learn how to create a two-layer map by first plotting regions from a shapefile and then plotting location points as a scatterplot.

## [Biomedical Image Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
The field of biomedical imaging has exploded in recent years - but for the uninitiated, even loading data can be a challenge! In this introductory course, you'll learn the fundamentals of image analysis using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. You'll navigate through a whole-body CT scan, segment a cardiac MRI time series, and determine whether Alzheimer’s disease changes brain structure. Even if you have never worked with images before, you will finish the course with a solid toolkit for entering this dynamic field.

### Exploration
Prepare to conquer the Nth dimension! To begin the course, you'll learn how to load, build and navigate N-dimensional images using a CT image of the human chest. You'll also leverage the useful ImageIO package and hone your NumPy and matplotlib skills.

## [Building Recommendation Engines with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/recommendation-engines-in-pyspark) (4 hours)
This course will show you how to build  recommendation engines using Alternating Least Squares in PySpark. Using the popular MovieLens dataset and the Million Songs dataset, this course will take you step by step through the intuition of the Alternating Least Squares algorithm as well as the code to train, test and implement ALS models on various types of customer data. 

### Recommendations Are Everywhere
This chapter will show you how powerful recommendations engines can be, and provide important distinctions between collaborative-filtering engines and content-based engines as well as the different types of implicit and explicit data that recommendation engines can use. You will also learn a very powerful way to uncover hidden features (latent features) that you may not even know exist in customer datasets.

### What if you don't have customer ratings?
In most real-life situations, you won't not have "perfect" customer data available to build an ALS model. This chapter will teach you how to use your customer behavior data to "infer" customer ratings and use those inferred ratings to build an ALS recommendation engine. Using the Million Songs Dataset as well as another version of the MovieLens dataset, this chapter will show you how to use the data available to you to build a recommendation engine using ALS and evaluate it's performance.

## [Web Scraping in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/web-scraping-with-python) (4 hours)
The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet has been and continues to be valuable in many veins of data science. In this course, you will learn to navigate and parse html code, and build tools to crawl websites automatically. Although our scraping will be conducted using the versatile Python library scrapy, many of the techniques you learn in this course can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Upon the completion of this course, you will have a strong mental model of html structure, will be able to build tools to parse html code and access desired information, and create a simple scrapy spiders to crawl the web at scale.

### Introduction to HTML
Learn the structure of HTML. We begin by explaining why web scraping can be a valuable addition to your data science toolbox and then delving into some basics of HTML. We end the chapter by giving a brief introduction on XPath notation, which is used to navigate the elements within HTML code.

## [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
A good proportion of the data out there in the real world is inherently spatial. From the population recorded in the national census, to every shop in your neighborhood, the majority of datasets have a location aspect that you can exploit to make the most of what they have to offer. This course will show you how to integrate spatial data into your Python Data Science workflow. You will learn how to interact with, manipulate and augment real-world data using their geographic dimension. You will learn to read tabular spatial data in the most common formats (e.g. GeoJSON, shapefile, geopackage) and visualize them in maps. You will then combine different sources using their location as the bridge that puts them in relation to each other. And, by the end of the course, you will be able to understand what makes geographic data unique, allowing you to transform and repurpose them in different contexts.

### Introduction to geospatial vector data
In this chapter, you will be introduced to the concepts of geospatial data, and more specifically of vector data. You will then learn how to represent such data in Python using the GeoPandas library, and the basics to read, explore and visualize such data. And you will exercise all this with some datasets about the city of Paris.

### Spatial relationships
One of the key aspects of geospatial data is how they relate to each other in space. In this chapter, you will learn the different spatial relationships, and how to use them in Python to query the data or to perform spatial joins. Finally, you will also learn in more detail about choropleth visualizations.

### Projecting and transforming geometries
In this chapter, we will take a deeper look into how the coordinates of the geometries are expressed based on their Coordinate Reference System (CRS). You will learn the importance of those reference systems and how to handle it in practice with GeoPandas. Further, you will also learn how to create new geometries based on the spatial relationships, which will allow you to overlay spatial datasets. And you will further practice this all with Paris datasets!

## [Advanced NLP with spaCy](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/advanced-nlp-with-spacy) (5 hours)
If you're working with a lot of text, you'll eventually want to know more about it. For example, what's it about? What do the words mean in context? Who is doing what to whom? What companies and products are mentioned? Which texts are similar to each other? In this course, you'll learn how to use spaCy, a fast-growing industry standard library for NLP in Python, to build advanced natural language understanding systems, using both rule-based and machine learning approaches.

### Finding words, phrases, names and concepts
This chapter will introduce you to the basics of text processing with spaCy. You'll learn about the data structures, how to work with statistical models, and how to use them to predict linguistic features in your text.

## [Supply Chain Analytics in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/supply-chain-analytics-in-python) (4 hours)
Supply Chain Analytics transforms supply chain activities from guessing, to ones that makes decision using data. An essential tool in Supply Chain Analytics is using optimization analysis to assist in decision making. According to Deloitte, 79% of organizations with high performing supply chains achieve revenue growth that is significantly above average. This course will introduce you to PuLP, a Linear Program optimization modeler written in Python. Using PuLP, the course will show you how to formulate and answer Supply Chain optimization questions such as where a production facility should be located, how to allocate production demand across different facilities, and more. We will explore the results of the models and their implications through sensitivity and simulation testing. This course will help you position yourself to improve the decision making of a supply chain by leveraging the power of Python and PuLP.

### Basics of supply chain optimization and PuLP

### Solve and evaluate model
This chapter reviews some common mistakes made when creating constraints, and step through the process of solving the model. Once we have a solution to our LP model, how do we know if it is correct? In this chapter we also review a process for reasonableness checking or sanity checking the results. Furthermore, we continue working through our case study example on the Capacitated Plant location model by completing all the needed constraints.

###  Sensitivity and simulation testing of model
In our final chapter we review sensitivity analysis of constraints through shadow prices and slack. Additionally, we look at simulation testing our LP models. These different techniques allow us to answer different business-related questions about our models, such as available capacity and incremental costs. Finally, we complete our case study exercise and focus on using sensitivity analysis and simulation testing to answer questions about our model.

## [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python) (4 hours)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that reduces the complexity of systems as is employs heavy re-usability of code. OOP leverages the concept of objects and classes. Objects may contain data (known as attributes, stored as instance or class variables) as well as procedures (defined as methods). Objects are generated from blueprints known as classes, which specify the attributes and methods to be generated at the time of object instantiation. This course introduces the internals of classes and the utilization of objects, as well as important object-oriented programming fundamentals such as inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

### Getting ready for object-oriented programming
In this chapter we quickly review functions and data structures, as they are building blocks of object-oriented programming. Then we transition into the conceptual definition of objects and classes.

### Inheritance, polymorphism and composition
In this chapter we cover inheritance, which is when we create a class that employs (or 'inherits') all class variables and methods from a 'parent' class. We also cover polymorphism, which is when multiple classes inherit from a single class. Finally, we cover composition, which is when classes employ specific class functionality from other classes without necessarily inheriting from them.

For example, you'll learn how to apply supervised learning algorithms to detect fraudulent behavior similar to past ones, as well as unsupervised learning methods to discover new types of fraud activities. Moreover, in fraud analytics you often deal with highly imbalanced datasets when classifying fraud versus non-fraud, and during this course you will pick up some techniques on how to deal with that. The course provides a mix of technical and theoretical insights and shows you hands-on how to practically implement fraud detection models. In addition, you will get tips and advice from real-life experience to help you prevent making common mistakes in fraud analytics.

## [Customer Segmentation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/customer-segmentation-in-python) (4 hours)
The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this course, you will learn real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. You will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. You will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, you will prepare the segments you created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, you will make your segments more powerful with k-means clustering, in just few lines of code! By the end of this course, you will be able to apply practical customer behavioral analytics and segmentation techniques.

### Cohort Analysis

## [Analyzing US Census Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-python) (5 hours)
Data scientists in diverse fields, from marketing to public health to civic hacking, need to work with demographic and socioeconomic data. Government census agencies offer richly detailed, high-quality datasets, but the number of variables and intricacies of administrative geographies (what is a Census tract anyway?) can make approaching this goldmine a daunting process. This course will introduce you to the Decennial Census and the annual American Community Survey, and show you where to find data on household income, commuting, race, family structure, and other topics that may interest you. You will use Python to request this data using the Census API for large and small geographies. You will manipulate the data using pandas, and create derived data such as a measure of segregation. You will also get a taste of the mapping capabilities of geopandas.

### Decennial Census of Population and Housing
Start exploring Census data products with the Decennial Census. Use the Census API and the requests package to retrieve data, load into pandas data frames, and conduct exploratory visualization in seaborn. Learn about important Census geographies, including states, counties, and tracts.

## [Big Data Fundamentals with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/big-data-fundamentals-via-pyspark) (4 hours)
There's been a lot of buzz about Big Data over the past few years, and it's finally become mainstream for many  companies. But what is this Big Data? This course covers the fundamentals of Big Data via PySpark. Spark is “lightning fast cluster computing"  framework for Big Data. It provides a general data processing platform engine and lets you run programs up to 100x faster in memory, or 10x faster on disk,  than Hadoop. You’ll use PySpark, a Python package for spark programming and its powerful, higher-level libraries such as SparkSQL, MLlib (for machine learning), etc.,  to interact with works of William Shakespeare, analyze Fifa football 2018 data and perform clustering of genomic datasets. At the end of this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of PySpark and it’s application to general Big Data analysis.

### Introduction to Big Data analysis with Spark

## [Dimensionality Reduction in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dimensionality-reduction-in-python) (4 hours)
High-dimensional datasets can be overwhelming and leave you not knowing where to start. Typically, you’d visually explore a new dataset first, but when you have too many dimensions the classical approaches will seem insufficient. Fortunately, there are visualization techniques designed specifically for high dimensional data and you’ll be introduced to these in this course. After exploring the data, you’ll often find that many features hold little information because they don’t show any variance or because they are duplicates of other features. You’ll learn how to detect these features and drop them from the dataset so that you can focus on the informative ones. In a next step, you might want to build a model on these features, and it may turn out that some don’t have any effect on the thing you’re trying to predict. You’ll learn how to detect and drop these irrelevant features too, in order to reduce dimensionality and thus complexity. Finally, you’ll learn how feature extraction techniques can reduce dimensionality for you through the calculation of uncorrelated principal components.

### Exploring high dimensional data
You'll be introduced to the concept of dimensionality reduction and will learn when an why this is important. You'll learn the difference between feature selection and feature extraction and will apply both techniques for data exploration.  The chapter ends with a lesson on t-SNE, a powerful feature extraction technique that will allow you to visualize a high-dimensional dataset.

### Feature selection I, selecting for feature information
In this first out of two chapters on feature selection, you'll learn about the curse of dimensionality and how dimensionality reduction can help you overcome it. You'll be introduced to a number of techniques to detect and remove features that bring little added value to the dataset. Either because they have little variance, too many missing values, or because they are strongly correlated to other features.

### Feature selection II, selecting for model accuracy
In this second chapter on feature selection, you'll learn how to let models help you find the most important features in a dataset for predicting a particular target feature. In the final lesson of this chapter, you'll combine the advice of multiple, different, models to decide on which features are worth keeping.

### Feature extraction
This chapter is a deep-dive on the most frequently used dimensionality reduction algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). You'll build intuition on how and why this algorithm is so powerful and will apply it both for data exploration and data pre-processing in a modeling pipeline.  You'll end with a cool image compression use case.

## [Working with Dates and Times in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-dates-and-times-in-python) (4 hours)
You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion.

### Dates and Calendars
Hurricanes (also known as cyclones or typhoons) hit the U.S. state of Florida several times per year. To start off this course, you'll learn how to work with date objects in Python, starting with the dates of every hurricane to hit Florida since 1950. You'll learn how Python handles dates, common date operations, and the right way to format dates to avoid confusion.

### Combining Dates and Times
Bike sharing programs have swept through cities around the world -- and luckily for us, every trip gets recorded! Working with all of the comings and goings of one bike in Washington, D.C., you'll practice working with dates and times together. You'll parse dates and times from text, analyze peak trip times, calculate ride durations, and more.

### Time Zones and Daylight Saving
In this chapter, you'll learn to confidently tackle the time-related topic that causes people the most trouble: time zones and daylight saving. Continuing with our bike data, you'll learn how to compare clocks around the world, how to gracefully handle "spring forward" and "fall back," and how to get up-to-date timezone data from the dateutil library.

### Easy and Powerful: Dates and Times in Pandas
To conclude this course, you'll apply everything you've learned about working with dates and times in standard Python to working with dates and times in Pandas. With additional information about each bike ride, such as what station it started and stopped at and whether or not the rider had a yearly membership, you'll be able to dig much more deeply into the bike trip data. In this chapter, you'll cover powerful Pandas operations, such as grouping and plotting results by time.

## [Designing Machine Learning Workflows in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/designing-machine-learning-workflows-in-python) (4 hours)
Deploying machine learning models in production seems easy with modern tools, but often ends in disappointment as the model performs worse in production than in development. This course will give you four superpowers that will make you stand out from the data science crowd and build pipelines that stand the test of time: how to exhaustively tune every aspect of your model in development; how to make the best possible use of available domain expertise; how to monitor your model in performance and deal with any performance deterioration; and finally how to deal with poorly or scarcely labelled data. Digging deep into the cutting edge of sklearn, and dealing with real-life datasets from hot areas like personalized healthcare and cybersecurity, this course reveals a view of machine learning from the frontline.

### The Standard Workflow
In this chapter, you will be reminded of the basics of a supervised learning workflow, complete with model fitting, tuning and selection, feature engineering and selection, and data splitting techniques. You will understand how these steps in a workflow depend on each other, and recognize how they can all contribute to, or fight against overfitting: the data scientist's worst enemy. By the end of the chapter, you will already be fluent in supervised learning, and ready to take the dive towards more advanced material in later chapters.

### The Human in the Loop
In the previous chapter, you perfected your knowledge of the standard supervised learning workflows. In this chapter, you will critically examine the ways in which expert knowledge is incorporated in supervised learning. This is done through the identification of the appropriate unit of analysis which might require feature engineering across multiple data sources, through the sometimes imperfect process of labeling examples, and through the specification of a loss function that captures the true business value of errors made by your machine learning model.

### Model Lifecycle Management
In the previous chapter, you employed different ways of incorporating feedback from experts in your workflow, and evaluating it in ways that are aligned with business value. Now it is time for you to practice the skills needed to productize your model and ensure it continues to perform well thereafter by iteratively improving it. You will also learn to diagnose dataset shift and mitigate the effect that a changing environment can have on your model's accuracy.

### Unsupervised Workflows
In the previous chapters you established a solid foundation in supervised learning, complete with knowledge of deploying models in production but always assumed you a labeled dataset would be available for your analysis. In this chapter, you take on the challenge of modeling data without any, or with very few, labels. This takes you into a journey into anomaly detection, a kind of unsupervised modeling, as well as distance-based learning, where beliefs about what constitutes similarity between two examples can be used in place of labels to help you achieve levels of accuracy comparable to a supervised workflow. Upon completing this chapter, you will clearly stand out from the crowd of data scientists in confidently knowing what tools to use to modify your workflow in order to overcome common real-world challenges.

## [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
Every day you read about the amazing breakthroughs in how the newest applications of machine learning are changing the world. Often this reporting glosses over the fact that a huge amount of data munging and feature engineering must be done before any of these fancy models can be used. In this course, you will learn how to do just that. You will work with Stack Overflow Developers survey, and historic US presidential inauguration addresses, to understand how best to preprocess and engineer features from categorical, continuous, and unstructured data. This course will give you hands-on experience on how to prepare any data for your own machine learning models.

### Creating Features
In this chapter, you will explore what feature engineering is and how to get started with applying it to real-world data. You will load, explore and visualize a survey response dataset, and in doing so you will learn about its underlying data types and why they have an influence on how you should engineer your features. Using the pandas package you will create new features from both categorical and continuous columns.

## [Foundations of Probability in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-python) (5 hours)
Probability is the study of regularities that emerge in the outcomes of random experiments. In this course, you'll learn about fundamental probability concepts like random variables (starting with the classic coin flip example) and how to calculate mean and variance, probability distributions, and conditional probability. We'll also explore two very important results in probability: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Since probability is at the core of data science and machine learning, these concepts will help you understand and apply models more robustly. Chances are everywhere, and the study of probability will change the way you see the world. Let’s get random!

### Let's start flipping coins
A coin flip is the classic example of a random experiment. The possible outcomes are heads or tails. This type of experiment, known as a Bernoulli or binomial trial, allows us to study problems with two possible outcomes, like “yes” or “no” and “vote” or “no vote.” This chapter introduces Bernoulli experiments, binomial distributions to model multiple Bernoulli trials, and probability simulations with the scipy library.

### Calculate some probabilities
In this chapter you'll learn to calculate various kinds of probabilities, such as the probability of the intersection of two events and the sum of probabilities of two events, and to simulate those situations. You'll also learn about conditional probability and how to apply Bayes' rule.

### Important probability distributions
Until now we've been working with binomial distributions, but there are many probability distributions a random variable can take. In this chapter we'll introduce three more that are related to the binomial distribution: the normal, Poisson, and geometric distributions.

### Probability meets statistics
No that you know how to calculate probabilities and important properties of probability distributions, we'll introduce two important results: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. This will expand your understanding on how the sample mean converges to the population mean as more data is available and how the sum of random variables behaves under certain conditions.

We will also explore connections between linear and logistic regressions as applications of probability and statistics in data science.

## [Optimizing Python Code with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/optimizing-python-code-with-pandas) (4 hours)
The ability to efficiently work with big datasets and extract valuable information is an indispensable tool for every aspiring data scientist. When working with a small amount of data, we often don’t realize how slow code execution can be. This course will build on your knowledge of Python and the pandas library and introduce you to efficient built-in pandas functions to perform tasks faster. Pandas’ built-in functions allow you to tackle the simplest tasks, like targeting specific entries and features from the data, to the most complex tasks, like applying functions on groups of entries, much faster than Python's usual methods. By the end of this course, you will be able to apply a function to data based on a feature value, iterate through big datasets rapidly, and manipulate data belonging to different groups efficiently. You will apply these methods on a variety of real-world datasets, such as poker hands or restaurant tips.

### Selecting columns and rows efficiently
This chapter will give you an overview of why efficient code matters and selecting specific and random rows and columns efficiently.

## [Improving Your Data Visualizations in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/improving-your-data-visualizations-in-python) (4 hours)
Great data visualization is the cornerstone of impactful data science. Visualization helps you to both find insight in your data and share those insights with your audience. Everyone learns how to make a basic scatter plot or bar chart on their journey to becoming a data scientist, but the true potential of data visualization is realized when you take a step back and think about what, why, and how you are visualizing your data. In this course you will learn how to construct compelling and attractive visualizations that help you communicate the results of your analyses efficiently and effectively. We will cover comparing data, the ins and outs of color, showing uncertainty, and how to build the right visualization for your given audience through the investigation of a datasets on air pollution around the US and farmer's markets. We will finish the course by examining open-access farmers market data to build a polished and impactful visual report.

### Highlighting your data
How do you show all of your data while making sure that viewers don't miss an important point or points? Here we discuss how to guide your viewer through the data with color-based highlights and text. We also introduce a dataset on common pollutant values across the United States.

### Showing uncertainty
Uncertainty occurs everywhere in data science, but it's frequently left out of visualizations where it should be included. Here, we review what a confidence interval is and how to visualize them for both single estimates and continuous functions. Additionally, we discuss the bootstrap resampling technique for assessing uncertainty and how to visualize it properly.

## [Clustering Methods with SciPy](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/clustering-methods-with-scipy) (4 hours)
You have probably come across Google News, which automatically groups similar news articles under a topic. Have you ever wondered what process runs in the background to arrive at these groups? In this course, you will be introduced to unsupervised learning through clustering using the SciPy library in Python. This course covers pre-processing of data and application of hierarchical and k-means clustering. Through the course, you will explore player statistics from a popular football video game, FIFA 18. After completing the course, you will be able to quickly apply various clustering algorithms on data, visualize the clusters formed and analyze results.

### Introduction to Clustering
Before you are ready to classify news articles, you need to be introduced to the basics of clustering. This chapter familiarizes you with a class of machine learning algorithms called unsupervised learning and then introduces you to clustering, one of the popular unsupervised learning algorithms. You will know about two popular clustering techniques - hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. The chapter concludes with basic pre-processing steps before you start clustering data.

### K-Means Clustering
This chapter introduces a different clustering algorithm - k-means clustering - and its implementation in SciPy. K-means clustering overcomes the biggest drawback of hierarchical clustering that was discussed in the last chapter. As dendrograms are specific to hierarchical clustering, this chapter discusses one method to find the number of clusters before running k-means clustering. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the limitations of k-means clustering and discusses considerations while using this algorithm.

## [Analyzing Marketing Campaigns with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-marketing-campaigns-with-pandas) (4 hours)
One of the biggest challenges when studying data science technical skills is understanding how those skills and concepts translate into real jobs. Whether you're looking to level up in your marketing job by incorporating Python and pandas or you're trying to get a handle on what kinds of work a data scientist in a marketing organization might do, this course is a great match for you. We'll practice translating common business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. This course will build on Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.

## [Machine Learning with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-apache-spark) (4 hours)
Spark is a powerful, general purpose tool for working with Big Data. Spark transparently handles the distribution of compute tasks across a cluster. This means that operations are fast, but it also allows you to focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. In this course you'll learn how to get data into Spark and then delve into the three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and creating pipelines. Along the way you'll analyse a large dataset of flight delays and spam text messages. With this background you'll be ready to harness the power of Spark and apply it on your own Machine Learning projects!

### Introduction
Spark is a framework for working with Big Data. In this chapter you'll cover some background about Spark and Machine Learning. You'll then find out how to connect to Spark using Python and load CSV data.

## [Introduction to Spark SQL in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-spark-sql) (4 hours)
You're familiar with SQL, and have heard great things about Apache Spark. Then this course is for you! Apache Spark is a computing framework for processing big data. Spark SQL is a component of Apache Spark that works with tabular data. Window functions are an advanced feature of SQL that take Spark to a new level of usefulness.  You will use Spark SQL to analyze time series.  You will extract the most common sequences of words from a text document. You will create feature sets from natural language text and use them to predict the last word in a sentence using logistic regression. Spark combines the power of distributed computing with the ease of use of Python and SQL.

The course uses a natural language text dataset that is easy to understand. Sentences are sequences of words. Window functions are very suitable for manipulating sequence data. The same techniques taught here can be applied to sequences of song identifiers, video ids, or podcast ids.  Exercises include discovering frequent word sequences, and converting word sequences into machine learning feature set data for training a text classifier.

### Pyspark SQL
In this chapter you will learn how to create and query a SQL table in Spark.  Spark SQL brings the expressiveness of SQL to Spark.  You will also learn how to use SQL window functions in Spark.  Window functions perform a calculation across rows that are related to the current row.  They greatly simplify achieving results that are difficult to express using only joins and traditional aggregations.  We'll use window functions to perform running sums, running differences, and other operations that are challenging to perform in basic SQL.

### Caching, Logging, and the Spark UI
In the previous chapters you learned how to use the expressiveness of window function SQL.  However, this expressiveness now makes it important that you understand how to properly cache dataframes and cache SQL tables.  It is also important to know how to evaluate your application.  You learn how to do do this using the Spark UI.  You'll also learn a best practice for logging in Spark. Spark SQL brings with it another useful tool for tuning query performance issues, the query execution plan. You will learn how to use the execution plan for evaluating the provenance of a dataframe.

## [Introduction to TensorFlow in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-tensorflow-in-python) (4 hours)
Not long ago, cutting-edge computer vision algorithms couldn’t differentiate between images of cats and dogs. Today, a skilled data scientist equipped with nothing more than a laptop can classify tens of thousands of objects with greater accuracy than the human eye. In this course, you will use TensorFlow 2.0 to develop, train, and make predictions with the models that have powered major advances in recommendation systems, image classification, and FinTech. You will learn both high-level APIs, which will enable you to design and train deep learning models in 15 lines of code, and low-level APIs, which will allow you to move beyond off-the-shelf routines. You will also learn to accurately predict housing prices, credit card borrower defaults, and images of sign language gestures.

### Introduction to TensorFlow
Before you can build advanced models in TensorFlow 2.0, you will first need to understand the basics. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to define constants and variables, perform tensor addition and multiplication, and compute derivatives.

## [Model Validation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/model-validation-in-python) (4 hours)
Machine learning models are easier to implement now more than ever before. Without proper validation, the results of running new data through a model might not be as accurate as expected. Model validation allows analysts to confidently answer the question, how good is your model? We will answer this question for classification models using the complete set of tic-tac-toe endgame scenarios, and for regression models using fivethirtyeight’s ultimate Halloween candy power ranking dataset. In this course, we will cover the basics of model validation, discuss various validation techniques, and begin to develop tools for creating validated and high performing models.

### Basic Modeling in scikit-learn
Before we can validate models, we need an understanding of how to create and work with them. This chapter provides an introduction to running regression and classification models in scikit-learn. We will use this model building foundation throughout the remaining chapters.

### Cross Validation
Holdout sets are a great start to model validation. However, using a single train and test set if often not enough. Cross-validation is considered the gold standard when it comes to validating model performance and is almost always used when tuning model hyper-parameters. This chapter focuses on performing cross-validation to validate model performance.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
How do we get from data to answers?  Exploratory data analysis is a process for exploring datasets, answering questions, and visualizing results.  This course presents the tools you need to clean and validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression models to predict and explain.  You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey.  But the methods you learn apply to all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization.  With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real data, make discoveries, and present compelling results.

### Read, clean, and validate
The first step of almost any data project is to read the data, check for errors and special cases, and prepare data for analysis. This is exactly what you'll do in this chapter, while working with a dataset obtained from the National Survey of Family Growth.

### Relationships
Up until this point, you've only looked at one variable at a time. In this chapter, you'll explore relationships between variables two at a time, using scatter plots and other visualizations to extract insights from a new dataset obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). You'll also learn how to quantify those relationships using correlation and simple regression.

## [Generalized Linear Models in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/generalized-linear-models-in-python) (5 hours)
Imagine being able to handle data where the response variable is either binary, count, or approximately normal, all under one single framework. Well, you don't have to imagine. Enter the Generalized Linear Models in Python course! In this course you will extend your regression toolbox with the logistic and Poisson models, by learning how to fit, understand, assess model performance and finally use the model to make predictions on new data. You will practice using data from real world studies such the largest population poisoning in world's history, nesting of horseshoe crabs and counting the bike crossings on the bridges in New York City.

### Introduction to GLMs
Review linear models and learn how GLMs are an extension of the linear model given different types of response variables. You will also learn the building blocks of GLMs and the technical process of fitting a GLM in Python.

## [Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-pytorch) (4 hours)
Neural networks have been at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence research during the last few years, and have provided solutions to many difficult problems like image classification, language translation or Alpha Go. PyTorch is one of the leading deep learning frameworks, being at the same time both powerful and easy to use. In this course you will use PyTorch to first learn about the basic concepts of neural networks, before building your first neural network to predict digits from MNIST dataset. You will then learn about convolutional neural networks, and use them to build much more powerful models which give more accurate results. You will evaluate the results and use different techniques to improve them. Following the course, you will be able to delve deeper into neural networks and start your career in this fascinating field.

## [Writing Functions in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-python) (4 hours)
You've done your analysis, built your report, and trained a model. What's next? Well, if you want to deploy your model into production, your code will need to be more reliable than exploratory scripts in a Jupyter notebook. Writing Functions in Python will give you a strong foundation in writing complex and beautiful functions so that you can contribute research and engineering skills to your team. You'll learn useful tricks, like how to write context managers and decorators. You'll also learn best practices around how to write maintainable reusable functions with good documentation. They say that people who can do good research and write high-quality code are unicorns. Take this course and discover the magic!

### Best Practices
The goal of this course is to transform you into a Python expert, and so the first chapter starts off with best practices when writing functions. We'll cover docstrings and why they matter and how to know when you need to turn a chunk of code into a function. You will also learn the details of how Python passes arguments to functions, as well as some common gotchas that can cause debugging headaches when calling functions.

## [Unit Testing for Data Science in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unit-testing-for-data-science-in-python) (4 hours)
Every data science project needs unit testing. It comes with huge benefits - saving a lot of development and maintenance time, improving documentation, increasing end-user trust and reducing downtime of productive systems. As a result, unit testing has become a must-have skill in the industry, used by almost every company. This course teaches unit testing in Python using the most popular testing framework pytest. By the end of this course, you will have written a complete test suite for a data science project. In the process, you will learn to write unit tests for data preprocessors, models and visualizations, interpret test results and fix any buggy code. You will also learn advanced concepts like TDD, test organization, fixtures and mocking so that you can test your own data science projects properly.

### Unit testing basics
In this chapter, you will get introduced to the pytest package and use it to write simple unit tests. You'll run the tests, interpret the test result reports and fix bugs. Throughout the chapter, we will use examples exclusively from the data preprocessing module of a linear regression project, making sure you learn unit testing in the context of data science.

### Intermediate unit testing
In this chapter, you will write more advanced unit tests. Starting from testing complicated data types like NumPy arrays to testing exception handling, you'll do it all. Once you have mastered the science of testing, we will also focus on the arts. For example, we will learn how to find the balance between writing too many tests and too few tests.  In the last lesson, you will get introduced to a radically new programming methodology called Test Driven Development (TDD) and put it to practice. This might actually change the way you code forever!

## [Analyzing IoT Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-iot-data-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever heard about Internet of Things devices? Of course, you have. Maybe you also have a Raspberry PI in your house monitoring the temperature and humidity.
  IoT devices are everywhere around us, collecting data about our environment.
  You will be analyzing Environmental data, Traffic data as well as energy counter data.
  Following the course, you will learn how to collect and store data from a data stream.
  You will prepare IoT data for analysis, analyze and visualize IoT data, before  implementing
  a simple machine learning model to take action when certain events occur and deploy this model
  to a real-time data stream.

### Accessing IoT Data
In this chapter, you will first understand what IoT data is.
Then, you learn how to aquire IoT data through a REST API and using an MQTT data stream to collect data in real time.

## [Preparing for Coding Interview Questions in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preparing-for-coding-interview-questions-in-python) (4 hours)
Coding interviews can be challenging. You might be asked questions to test your knowledge of a programming language. On the other side, you can be given a task to solve in order to check how you think. And when you are interviewed for a data scientist position, it's likely you can be asked on the corresponding tools available for the language. In either of the cases, to get a cool position as a data scientist, you need to do a little work to perform the best. That's why it's very important to practice in order to prove your expertise! This course serves as a guide for those who just start their path to become a professional data scientist and as a refresher for those who seek for other opportunities. We'll go through fundamental as well as advanced topics that aim to prepare you for a coding interview in Python. Since it is not a normal step-by-step course, some exercises can be quite complex. But who said that interviews are easy to pass, right?

### Python Data Structures and String Manipulation
In this chapter, we'll refresh our knowledge of the main data structures used in Python.  We'll cover how to deal with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.  We'll also consider strings and how to write regular expressions to retrieve specific character sequences from a given text.

### Iterable objects and representatives
This chapter focuses on iterable objects. We'll refresh the definition of iterable objects and explain, how to identify one.  Next, we'll cover list comprehensions, which is a very special feature of Python programming language to define lists.  Then, we'll recall how to combine several iterable objects into one. Finally, we'll cover how to create custom iterable objects using generators.

### Functions and lambda expressions
This chapter will focus on the functional aspects of Python. We'll start by defining functions with a variable amount of positional as well as keyword arguments.  Next, we'll cover lambda functions and in which cases they can be helpful. Especially, we'll see how to use them with such functions as map(), filter(), and reduce(). Finally, we'll recall what is recursion and how to correctly implement one.

## [Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (4 hours)
Deep learning is here to stay! It's the go-to technique to solve complex problems that arise with unstructured data and an incredible tool for innovation. Keras is one of the frameworks that make it easier to start developing deep learning models, and it's versatile enough to build industry-ready models in no time. In this course, you will learn regression and save the earth by predicting asteroid trajectories, apply binary classification to distinguish between real and fake dollar bills, use multiclass classification to decide who threw which dart at a dart board, learn to use neural networks to reconstruct noisy images and much more. Additionally, you will learn how to better control your models during training and how to tune them to boost their performance.

### Introducing Keras
In this first chapter, you will get introduced to neural networks, understand what kind of problems they can solve, and when to use them. You will also build several networks and save the earth by training a regression model that approximates the orbit of a meteor that is approaching us!

## [Experimental Design in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/experimental-design-in-python) (4 hours)
Data is all around us and can help us to understand many things. Making a pretty graph is great, but how can we tell the difference between a few outliers on a graph and a real, reliable effect? Is a trend that we see on a graph a reliable result or just random chance playing tricks? In this course, you will learn how to interrogate datasets in a rigorous way, giving clear answers to your questions. You will learn a range of statistical tests, how to apply them, how to understand their results, and how to deal with their shortcomings. Along the way, you will explore Olympic athlete data and the differences between populations of continents.

### The Basics of Statistical Hypothesis Testing
In this chapter, you will learn how to explore your data and ask meaningful questions. Then, you will discover how to answer these question by using your first statistical hypothesis tests: the t-test, the Chi-Square test, the Fisher exact test, and the Pearson correlation test.

## [Streamlined Data Ingestion with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/streamlined-data-ingestion-with-pandas) (4 hours)
Before you can analyze data, you first have to acquire it. This course teaches you how to build pipelines to import data kept in common storage formats. You’ll use pandas, a major Python library for analytics, to get data from a variety of sources, from spreadsheets of survey responses, to a database of public service requests, to an API for a popular review site. Along the way, you’ll learn how to fine-tune imports to get only what you need and to address issues like incorrect data types. Finally, you’ll assemble a custom dataset from a mix of sources.

### Importing Data from Flat Files

## [Sentiment Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/sentiment-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you left a review to express how you feel about a product or a service? And do you have a habit of checking a product’s reviews online before you buy it? This kind of information is valuable not only for you but also for companies. In this course, you will learn how to make sense of the sentiment expressed in various documents. You will use real-world datasets featuring tweets, movie and product reviews, and use Python’s nltk and scikit-learn packages. By the end of the course, you will be able to carry an end-to-end sentiment analysis task based on how US airline passengers expressed their feelings on Twitter.

### Sentiment Analysis Nuts and Bolts
Have you ever checked the reviews or ratings of a product or a service before you purchased it? Then you have very likely came face-to-face with sentiment analysis. In this chapter,  you will learn the basic structure of a sentiment analysis problem and start exploring the sentiment of movie reviews.

### Sequence to Sequence Models
This chapter introduces you to two applications of RNN models: Text Generation and Neural Machine Translation.  You will learn how to prepare the text data to the format needed by the models.
The Text Generation model is used for replicating a character's way of speech and will have some fun mimicking Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. 
Neural Machine Translation is used for example by Google Translate in a much more complex model. In this chapter, you will create a model that translates Portuguese small phrases into English.

## [Machine Translation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-translation-in-python) (4 hours)
The need to pack a bilingual dictionary for your European holiday or keeping one on your desk to complete your foreign language homework is a thing of the past. You just hop on the internet and make use of a language translation service to quickly understand what the street sign means or finding out how to greet and thank a foreigner in their language. Behind the language translation services are complex machine translation models. Have you ever wondered how these models work? This course will allow you to explore the inner workings of a machine translation model. You will use Keras, a powerful Python-based deep learning library, to implement a translation model. You will then train the model to perform an English to French translation, and you will be shown techniques to improve your model. At the end of this course, you would have developed an in-depth understanding of machine translation models and appreciate them even more!

## [Spoken Language Processing in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/spoken-language-processing-in-python) (4 hours)
We learn to speak far before we learn to read. Even in the digital age, our main method of communication is speech. Spoken Language Processing with Python will help you load, transform and transcribe audio files. You'll start by seeing what raw audio looks like in Python. And then finish by working through an example business use case, transcribing and classifying phone call data.

### Introduction to Spoken Language Processing with Python
Audio files are different from most other types of data. Before you can start working with them, they require some preprocessing. In this chapter, you'll learn the first steps to working with speech files by converting two different audio files into soundwaves and comparing them visually.

### Manipulating Audio Files with PyDub
Not all audio files come in the same shape, size or format. Luckily, the PyDub library by James Robert provides tools which you can use to programmatically alter and change different audio file attributes such as frame rate, number of channels, file format and more. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use this helpful library to ensure all of your audio files are in the right shape for transcription.

## [Building Data Engineering Pipelines in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-data-engineering-pipelines-in-python) (4 hours)
In any data-driven company, you will undoubtedly cross paths with data engineers. Among other things, they facilitate some of your work by making data readily available to everyone within the organization, and possibly in bringing machine learning models into production. One way to speed up this process is through building an understanding of what it means to bring processes into production and what features are of high-grade code. In this course, we’ll be looking at various data pipelines the data engineer is building, and how some of the tools he or she is using can help you in getting your models into production or run repetitive tasks consistently and efficiently.
<br /> <br />
In this course, we illustrate common elements of data engineering pipelines. In Chapter 1, you will learn how to ingest data. Chapter 2 will go one step further with cleaning and transforming data. In Chapter 3, you will learn how to safely deploy code. Finally, in Chapter 4 you will schedule complex dependencies between applications.
<br /> <br />
<i>Building Data Engineering Pipelines covers new technologies and material, so we recommend that you have a strong understanding of the prerequisites to get the most out of this course.</i>

### Ingesting Data
After seeing this chapter, you will be able to explain what a data platform is, how data ends up in it, and how data engineers structure its foundations. You will be able to ingest data from a RESTful API into the data platform’s data lake using a self-written ingestion pipeline, made using Singer’s taps and targets.

### Testing your data pipeline
Stating “it works on my machine” is not a guarantee it will work reliably elsewhere and in the future. Requirements for your project will change. In this chapter, we explore different forms of testing and learn how to write unit tests for our PySpark data transformation pipeline, so that we make robust and reusable parts.

## [Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-portfolio-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever had wondered whether an investment fund is actually a good investment? Or compared two investment options and asked what the difference between the two is? What does the risk indicator of these funds even mean? Or do you frequently work with financial data in your daily job and you want to get an edge? In this course, you’re going to get familiar with the exciting world of investing, by learning about portfolios, risk and return, and how to critically analyze them. By working on actual historical stock data, you’ll learn how to calculate meaningful measures of risk, how to break-down performance, and how to calculate an optimal portfolio for the desired risk and return trade-off. After this course, you’ll be able to make data-driven decisions when it comes to investing and have a better understanding of investment portfolios.

### Introduction to Portfolio Analysis
In the first chapter, you’ll learn how a portfolio is build up out of individual assets and corresponding weights. The chapter also covers how to calculate the main characteristics of a portfolio: returns and risk.

### Risk and Return
Chapter 2 goes deeper into how to measure returns and risk accurately. The two most important measures of return, annualized returns, and risk-adjusted returns, are covered in the first part of the chapter. In the second part, you’ll learn how to look at risk from different perspectives. This part focuses on skewness and kurtosis of a distribution, as well as downside risk.

## [Credit Risk Modeling in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/credit-risk-modeling-in-python) (4 hours)
If you've ever applied for a credit card or loan, you know that financial firms process your information before making a decision.  This is because giving you a loan can have a serious financial impact on their business.  But how do they make a decision?  In this course, you will learn how to prepare credit application data.  After that, you will apply machine learning and business rules to reduce risk and ensure profitability.  You will use two data sets that emulate real credit applications while focusing on business value. Join me and learn the expected value of credit risk modeling!

### Exploring and Preparing Loan Data
In this first chapter, we will discuss the concept of credit risk and define how it is calculated.  Using cross tables and plots, we will explore a real-world data set.  Before applying machine learning, we will process this data by finding and resolving problems.

### Logistic Regression for Defaults
With the loan data fully prepared, we will discuss the logistic regression model which is a standard in risk modeling.  We will understand the components of this model as well as how to score its performance.   Once we've created predictions, we can explore the financial impact of utilizing this model.

## [Machine Learning for Marketing in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-marketing-in-python) (4 hours)
The rise of machine learning (almost sounds like "rise of the machines"?) and applications of statistical methods to marketing have changed the field forever. Machine learning is being used to optimize customer journeys which maximize their satisfaction and lifetime value. This course will give you the foundational tools which you can immediately apply to improve your company’s marketing strategy. You will learn how to use different techniques to predict customer churn and interpret its drivers, measure, and forecast customer lifetime value, and finally, build customer segments based on their product purchase patterns. You will use customer data from a telecom company to predict churn, construct a recency-frequency-monetary dataset from an online retailer for customer lifetime value prediction, and build customer segments from product purchase data from a grocery shop.

### Machine learning for marketing basics
In this chapter, you will explore the basics of machine learning methods used in marketing. You will learn about different types of machine learning, data preparation steps, and will run several end to end models to understand their power.

## [Preparing for Machine Learning Interview Questions in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preparing-for-machine-learning-interview-questions-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever wondered how to properly prepare for a Machine Learning Interview? Of course you have or you likely wouldn't be reading this right now! In this course, students will prepare to answer 15 common Machine Learning (ML) interview questions for a data scientist role in Python. These questions will revolve around 7 important topics: data preprocessing, data visualization, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model ensembling, model selection, and model evaluation. By the end of the course, the students will possess both the required theoretical background and the ability to develop Python code to successfully answer these 15 questions. The coding examples will be mainly based on the scikit-learn package given its ease-of-use and ability to cover the most important ML techniques in the Python language.
<br /> <br />
<i>The course does not teach machine learning fundamentals as these are covered in the course's prerequisites.</i>

## [Pandas Joins for Spreadsheet Users](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-joins-for-spreadsheet-users) (4 hours)
Joining two or more datasets is necessary for almost any real-world analysis. You’ve done it before with spreadsheets using VLOOKUP and related functions. Can you build on this experience as you transition to the world of Python? Yes! In this course you will learn the ins and outs of bringing datasets together with pandas, Python’s gold standard for manipulating tabular data. You’ll apply pandas functions to combine data from the National Football League (NFL) framed in a familiar spreadsheet environment. Armed with these skills you will be able to harness the power of pandas and integrate larger, more complex datasets into any analysis.

### Introduction to joining data
In this chapter, we'll build a foundation for using pandas to join data. You'll learn about the types of joins and how pandas can improve your effectiveness and productivity.

## [Introduction to Databases in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-relational-databases-in-python) (4 hours)
In this course, you'll learn the basics of using SQL with Python. This will be useful because databases are ubiquitous and data scientists, analysts, and engineers must interact with them constantly. The Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy provides an accessible and intuitive way to query, build, and write to essential databases, including SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

### Basics of Relational Databases
In this chapter, you’ll get acquainted with the fundamentals of relational databases and the relational model for database management. You will learn how to connect to a database and interact with it by writing basic SQL queries, both in raw SQL as well as SQLAlchemy, which provides a Pythonic way of interacting with databases.

## [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-2) (4 hours)
In this second Python Data Science Toolbox course, you'll continue to build your Python data science skills. First, you'll learn about iterators, objects you have already encountered in the context of for loops. You'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools for all data scientists working in Python. You'll end the course by working through a case study in which you'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this course.

### Using iterators in PythonLand
You'll learn all about iterators and iterables, which you have already worked with when writing for loops. You'll learn some handy functions that will allow you to effectively work with iterators. And you’ll finish the chapter with a use case that is pertinent to the world of data science and dealing with large amounts of data—in this case, data from Twitter that you will load in chunks using iterators.

### List comprehensions and generators
In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists—and lists of lists—in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python data science toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory, but instead generate on the fly.

## [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1) (3 hours)
It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.

### Writing your own functions
In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1) (3 hours)
After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

### Graphical exploratory data analysis
Before diving into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data.

### Thinking probabilistically-- Discrete variables
Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data. In this chapter, you will learn how to think probabilistically about discrete quantities: those that can only take certain values, like integers.

It’s time to move onto continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2) (4 hours)
After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

### Parameter estimation by optimization
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. A probability distribution that describes your data has parameters. So, a major goal of statistical inference is to estimate the values of these parameters, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.

### Bootstrap confidence intervals
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.

### Introduction to hypothesis testing
You now know how to define and estimate parameters given a model. But the question remains: how reasonable is it to observe your data if a model is true? This question is addressed by hypothesis tests. They are the icing on the inference cake. After completing this chapter, you will be able to carefully construct and test hypotheses using hacker statistics.

### Hypothesis test examples
As you saw from the last chapter, hypothesis testing can be a bit tricky. You need to define the null hypothesis, figure out how to simulate it, and define clearly what it means to be "more extreme" in order to compute the p-value. Like any skill, practice makes perfect, and this chapter gives you some good practice with hypothesis tests.

### Putting it all together: a case study
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!

## [Importing Data in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/importing-data-in-python-part-2) (2 hours)
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it, build predictive models and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, you will need to know how to get data into Python. In the prequel to this course, you learned many ways to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL. In this course, you'll extend this knowledge base by learning to import data from the web and by pulling data from Application Programming Interfaces— APIs—such as the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets.

### Importing data from the Internet

## [Merging DataFrames with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/merging-dataframes-with-pandas) (4 hours)
As a data scientist, you'll often find that the data you need is not in a single file. It may be spread across a number of text files, spreadsheets, or databases. You’ll want to be able to import the data you’re interested in as a collection of DataFrames and combine them to answer your central questions. This course is all about the act of combining—or merging—DataFrames, an essential part of any data scientist's toolbox. You'll hone your pandas skills by learning how to organize, reshape, and aggregate multiple datasets to answer your specific questions.

### Preparing data
In this chapter, you'll learn about different techniques you can use to import multiple files into DataFrames. Having imported your data into individual DataFrames, you'll then learn how to share information between DataFrames using their indexes. Understanding how indexes work is essential to merging DataFrames, which you’ll learn later in the course.

## [Unsupervised Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unsupervised-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
Say you have a collection of customers with a variety of characteristics such as age, location, and financial history, and you wish to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Or perhaps you have a set of texts, such as wikipedia pages, and you wish to segment them into categories based on their content. This is the world of unsupervised learning, called as such because you are not guiding, or supervising, the pattern discovery by some prediction task, but instead uncovering hidden structure from unlabeled data. Unsupervised learning encompasses a variety of techniques in machine learning, from clustering to dimension reduction to matrix factorization. In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. You will learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.

### Clustering for dataset exploration
Learn how to discover the underlying groups (or "clusters") in a dataset.  By the end of this chapter, you'll be clustering companies using their stock market prices, and distinguishing different species by clustering their measurements.

## [Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-the-experts-school-budgets) (4 hours)
Data science isn't just for predicting ad-clicks-it's also useful for social impact! This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. You'll explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, you'll begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, you'll do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, you'll have the opportunity to try your own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, you'll see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.

### Exploring the raw data
In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the problem you'll be solving in this course. How do you accurately classify line-items in a school budget based on what that money is being used for? You will explore the raw text and numeric values in the dataset, both quantitatively and visually. And you'll learn how to measure success when trying to predict class labels for each row of the dataset.

## [Time Series Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-time-series-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, you'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance.

### Correlation and Autocorrelation
In this chapter you'll be introduced to the ideas of correlation and autocorrelation for time series. Correlation describes the relationship between two time series and autocorrelation describes the relationship of a time series with its past values.

## [Parallel Computing with Dask](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/parallel-computing-with-dask) (4 hours)
Python is now well established as a major platform for data analysis and data science. For many data scientists, the largest limitation of Python is that all data must fit into the resident memory of the available workstation. Further, traditionally, Python has only been able to utilize one CPU. Data scientists constantly ask, "How can I read and process large amounts of data?" and "How can I make use of more computational processing resources?" This course will introduce you to Dask, a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing. With Dask, you will be able to take the Python workflows you currently have and easily scale them up to large datasets on your workstation without the need to migrate to a distributed computing environment.


### Working with Big Data
In this chapter you'll learn how to leverage traditional Python techniques for reading and processing large datasets stored in either a single file or in multiple files. Finally, you'll learn how the Dask library can be used to execute a pipeline of Python functions in parallel with the added goal of being able to process large amounts of data on modest computational resources.
For this course, the data set sizes have been reduced so that the exercises can be completed rapidly. Many of these data sets were originally several Gigabytes in size.

### Working with Dask Arrays
In this chapter we'll explore how we can use `dask.array` to read multiple data sources and perform computations with them as a single data array. We'll learn some advanced uses of NumPy arrays when dealing with high dimensional data that also work on Dask arrays. Finally, we'll examine climate patterns in the US from monthly weather data in the US.

## [Case Studies in Statistical Thinking](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-studies-in-statistical-thinking) (4 hours)
Mastery requires practice. Having completed Statistical Thinking I and II, you developed your probabilistic mindset and the hacker stats skills to extract actionable insights from your data. Your foundation is in place, and now it is time practice your craft.

In this course, you will apply your statistical thinking skills, exploratory data analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, to two new real-world data sets. First, you will explore data from the 2013 and 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships, where you will quantify the relative speeds and variability among swimmers. You will then perform a statistical analysis to assess the "current controversy" of the 2013 Worlds in which swimmers claimed that a slight current in the pool was affecting result. Second, you will study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes around the world. Finally, you will analyze the changes in seismicity in the US state of Oklahoma after the practice of high pressure waste water injection at oil extraction sites became commonplace in the last decade. As you work with these data sets, you will take vital steps toward mastery as you cement your existing knowledge and broaden your abilities to use statistics and Python to make sense of your data.

### Statistical seismology and the Parkfield region
Herein, you'll use your statistical thinking skills to study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes. Along the way, you'll learn some basic statistical seismology, including the Gutenberg-Richter law. This exercise exposes two key ideas about data science: 1) As a data scientist, you wander into all sorts of domain specific analyses, which is very exciting. You constantly get to learn. 2) You are sometimes faced with limited data, which is also the case for many of these earthquake studies. You can still make good progress!

## [Python for R Users](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-for-r-users) (5 hours)
Python and R have seen immense growth in popularity in the "Machine Learning Age". They both are high-level languages that are easy to learn and write. The language you use will depend on your background and field of study and work. R is a language made by and for statisticians, whereas Python is a more general purpose programming language. Regardless of the background, there will be times when a particular algorithm is implemented in one language and not the other, a feature is better documented, or simply, the tutorial you found online uses Python instead of R.

In either case, this would require the R user to work in Python to get his/her work done, or try to understand how something is implemented in Python for it to be translated into R. This course helps you cross the R-Python language barrier.

### The Basics
Learn about some of the most important data types (integers, floats, strings, and booleans) and data structures (lists, dictionaries, numpy arrays, and pandas DataFrames) in Python and how they compare to the ones in R.

## [Introduction to Linear Modeling in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-linear-modeling-in-python) (4 hours)
One of the primary goals of any scientist is to find patterns in data and build models to describe, predict, and extract insight from those patterns. The most fundamental of these patterns is a linear relationship between two variables. This course provides an introduction to exploring, quantifying, and modeling linear relationships in data, by demonstrating techniques such as least-squares, linear regression, estimatation, and bootstrap resampling. Here you will apply the most powerful modeling tools in the python data science ecosystem, including scipy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn, to build and evaluate linear models. By exploring the concepts and applications of linear models with python, this course serves as both a practical introduction to modeling, and as a foundation for learning more advanced modeling techniques and tools in statistics and machine learning.

### Exploring Linear Trends
We start the course with an initial exploration of linear relationships, including some motivating examples of how linear models are used, and demonstrations of data visualization methods from matplotlib. We then use descriptive statistics to quantify the shape of our data and use correlation to quantify the strength of linear relationships between two variables.

### Building Linear Models
Here we look at the parts that go into building a linear model. Using the concept of a Taylor Series, we focus on the parameters slope and intercept, how they define the model, and how to interpret the them in several applied contexts. We apply a variety of python modules to find the model that best fits the data, by computing the optimal values of slope and intercept, using least-squares, numpy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn.

### Estimating Model Parameters
In our final chapter, we introduce concepts from inferential statistics, and use them to explore how maximum likelihood estimation and bootstrap resampling can be used to estimate linear model parameters. We then apply these methods to make probabilistic statements about our confidence in the model parameters.

## [Introduction to MongoDB in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-using-mongodb-for-data-science-with-python) (4 hours)
MongoDB is a tool to explore data structured as you see fit. As a NoSQL database, it doesn't follow the strict relational format imposed by SQL. By providing capabilities that typically require adding layers to SQL, it collapses complexity. With dynamic schema, you can handle vastly different data together and consolidate analytics. The flexibility of MongoDB empowers you to keep improving and fix issues as your requirements evolve. In this course, you will learn the MongoDB language and apply it to search and analytics. Working with unprocessed data from the official nobelprize.org API, you will explore and answer questions about Nobel Laureates and prizes.

### Flexibly Structured Data
This chapter is about getting a bird's-eye view of the Nobel Prize data's structure. You will relate MongoDB documents, collections, and databases to JSON and Python types. You'll then use filters, operators, and dot notation to explore substructure.

### Aggregation Pipelines: Let the Server Do It For You
You've used projection, sorting, indexing, and limits to speed up data fetching. But there are still annoying performance bottlenecks in your analysis pipelines. You still need to fetch a ton of data. Thus, network bandwidth and downstream processing and memory capacity still impact performance. This chapter is about using MongoDB to perform aggregations for you on the server.

## [Machine Learning for Time Series Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-time-series-data-in-python) (4 hours)
Time series data is ubiquitous. Whether it be stock market fluctuations, sensor data recording climate change, or activity in the brain, any signal that changes over time can be described as a time series. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful method for leveraging complexity in data in order to generate predictions and insights into the problem one is trying to solve. This course is an intersection between these two worlds of machine learning and time series data, and covers feature engineering, spectograms, and other advanced techniques in order to classify heartbeat sounds and predict stock prices. 

### Time Series and Machine Learning Primer
This chapter is an introduction to the basics of machine learning, time series data, and the intersection between the two.

## [Machine Learning with Tree-Based Models in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-tree-based-models-in-python) (5 hours)
Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. Tree models present a high flexibility that comes at a price: on one hand, trees are able to capture complex non-linear relationships; on the other hand, they are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset. By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. Ensemble methods are used across a variety of fields and have a proven track record of winning many machine learning competitions.
In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to train decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library. You'll understand the advantages and shortcomings of trees and demonstrate how ensembling can alleviate these shortcomings, all while practicing on real-world datasets. Finally, you'll also understand how to tune the most influential hyperparameters in order to get the most out of your models.

### Classification and Regression Trees
Classification and Regression Trees (CART) are a set of supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the CART algorithm.

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
The bias-variance tradeoff is one of the fundamental concepts in supervised machine learning. In this chapter, you'll understand how to diagnose the problems of overfitting and underfitting. You'll also be introduced to the concept of ensembling where the predictions of several models are aggregated to produce predictions that are more robust.

### Interpreting and explaining models
In a business context, it is often important to explain the intuition behind the model you built. Indeed, if the model and its variables do not make sense, the model might not be used. In this chapter you'll learn how to explain the relationship between the variables in the model and the target by means of predictor insight graphs.

## [Preprocessing for Machine Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preprocessing-for-machine-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
This course covers the basics of how and when to perform data preprocessing. This essential step in any machine learning project is when you get your data ready for modeling. Between importing and cleaning your data and fitting your machine learning model is when preprocessing comes into play. You'll learn how to standardize your data so that it's in the right form for your model, create new features to best leverage the information in your dataset, and select the best features to improve your model fit. Finally, you'll have some practice preprocessing by getting a dataset on UFO sightings ready for modeling.

### Introduction to Data Preprocessing
In this chapter you'll learn exactly what it means to preprocess data. You'll take the first steps in any preprocessing journey, including exploring data types and dealing with missing data.

## [Machine Learning for Finance in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-finance-in-python) (4 hours)
Time series data is all around us; some examples are the weather, human behavioral patterns as consumers and members of society, and financial data. In this course, you'll learn how to calculate technical indicators from historical stock data, and how to create features and targets out of the historical stock data. You'll understand how to prepare our features for linear models, xgboost models, and neural network models. We will then use linear models, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks to predict the future price of stocks in the US markets. You will also learn how to evaluate the performance of the various models we train in order to optimize them, so our predictions have enough accuracy to make a stock trading strategy profitable.

### Preparing data and a linear model
In this chapter, we will learn how machine learning can be used in finance.  We will also explore some stock data, and prepare it for machine learning algorithms.  Finally, we will fit our first machine learning model -- a linear model, in order to predict future price changes of stocks.

## [Statistical Simulation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-simulation-in-python) (4 hours)
Simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use the relatively simple idea of random sampling to solve increasingly complex problems. Although they have been around for ages, they have gained in popularity recently due to the rise in computational power and have seen applications in multiple domains including Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Computational Biology and Finance just to name a few. Students will use simulations to generate and analyze data over different probability distributions using the important NumPy package. This course will give students hands-on experience with simulations using simple, real-world applications.

### Basics of randomness & simulation
This chapter gives you the tools required to run a simulation. We'll start with a review of random variables and probability distributions. We will then learn how to run a simulation by first looking at a simulation workflow and then recreating it in the context of a game of dice. Finally, we will learn how to use simulations for making decisions.

### Formatting raw data, managing dates and financial periods
We have gotten a basic understanding of income statements and balance sheets. However, consolidating data for forecasting is complex, so in this chapter, we will look at some basic tools to help solve some of the complexities specifically relating to finance - working with dates and different financial periods, and formatting our raw data into the correct format for financial forecasting.

### Assumptions and variances in forecasts
In this chapter, we will be exploring two more aspects to creating a good forecast. First, we will look at assumptions, what drives them and what happens when an assumption changes? Next, we will look at variances, as a forecast is built at one point in time, but what happens when the actual results do not correspond to our forecast? We need to build a sensitive forecast that can be sensitive to changes in both assumptions and take into account variances, and this is what we will explore in this chapter.

### Dictionaries and pandas
This chapter introduces some powerful Python data structures: the dictionary and the pandas DataFrame. You will learn to create dictionaries by setting key-value pairs, and view then how to view and modify your dictionary. Then you will be introduced to one of the most important packages in the Pythonista's toolbox, pandas. Specifically, you'll focus on the pandas' structure, the DataFrame, which organizes tabular data in an easily accessible way. Lastly, you'll learn how to transform different data types into DataFrames to make your data easier to work with.

## [Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
One of the most important tasks of a data scientist is to understand the relationships between their data's physical location and their geographical context. In this course you'll be learning to make attractive visualizations of geospatial data with the GeoPandas package. You will learn to spatially join datasets, linking data to context. Finally you will learn to overlay geospatial data to maps to add even more spatial cues to your work. You will use several datasets from the City of Nashville's open data portal to find out where the chickens are in Nashville, which neighborhood has the most public art, and more!

### Building 2-layer maps : combining polygons and scatterplots
In this chapter, you will learn how to create a two-layer map by first plotting regions from a shapefile and then plotting location points as a scatterplot.

## [Biomedical Image Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/biomedical-image-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
The field of biomedical imaging has exploded in recent years - but for the uninitiated, even loading data can be a challenge! In this introductory course, you'll learn the fundamentals of image analysis using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. You'll navigate through a whole-body CT scan, segment a cardiac MRI time series, and determine whether Alzheimer’s disease changes brain structure. Even if you have never worked with images before, you will finish the course with a solid toolkit for entering this dynamic field.

### Exploration
Prepare to conquer the Nth dimension! To begin the course, you'll learn how to load, build and navigate N-dimensional images using a CT image of the human chest. You'll also leverage the useful ImageIO package and hone your NumPy and matplotlib skills.

## [Building Recommendation Engines with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/recommendation-engines-in-pyspark) (4 hours)
This course will show you how to build  recommendation engines using Alternating Least Squares in PySpark. Using the popular MovieLens dataset and the Million Songs dataset, this course will take you step by step through the intuition of the Alternating Least Squares algorithm as well as the code to train, test and implement ALS models on various types of customer data. 

### Recommendations Are Everywhere
This chapter will show you how powerful recommendations engines can be, and provide important distinctions between collaborative-filtering engines and content-based engines as well as the different types of implicit and explicit data that recommendation engines can use. You will also learn a very powerful way to uncover hidden features (latent features) that you may not even know exist in customer datasets.

### What if you don't have customer ratings?
In most real-life situations, you won't not have "perfect" customer data available to build an ALS model. This chapter will teach you how to use your customer behavior data to "infer" customer ratings and use those inferred ratings to build an ALS recommendation engine. Using the Million Songs Dataset as well as another version of the MovieLens dataset, this chapter will show you how to use the data available to you to build a recommendation engine using ALS and evaluate it's performance.

## [Web Scraping in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/web-scraping-with-python) (4 hours)
The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet has been and continues to be valuable in many veins of data science. In this course, you will learn to navigate and parse html code, and build tools to crawl websites automatically. Although our scraping will be conducted using the versatile Python library scrapy, many of the techniques you learn in this course can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Upon the completion of this course, you will have a strong mental model of html structure, will be able to build tools to parse html code and access desired information, and create a simple scrapy spiders to crawl the web at scale.

### Introduction to HTML
Learn the structure of HTML. We begin by explaining why web scraping can be a valuable addition to your data science toolbox and then delving into some basics of HTML. We end the chapter by giving a brief introduction on XPath notation, which is used to navigate the elements within HTML code.

## [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
A good proportion of the data out there in the real world is inherently spatial. From the population recorded in the national census, to every shop in your neighborhood, the majority of datasets have a location aspect that you can exploit to make the most of what they have to offer. This course will show you how to integrate spatial data into your Python Data Science workflow. You will learn how to interact with, manipulate and augment real-world data using their geographic dimension. You will learn to read tabular spatial data in the most common formats (e.g. GeoJSON, shapefile, geopackage) and visualize them in maps. You will then combine different sources using their location as the bridge that puts them in relation to each other. And, by the end of the course, you will be able to understand what makes geographic data unique, allowing you to transform and repurpose them in different contexts.

### Introduction to geospatial vector data
In this chapter, you will be introduced to the concepts of geospatial data, and more specifically of vector data. You will then learn how to represent such data in Python using the GeoPandas library, and the basics to read, explore and visualize such data. And you will exercise all this with some datasets about the city of Paris.

### Spatial relationships
One of the key aspects of geospatial data is how they relate to each other in space. In this chapter, you will learn the different spatial relationships, and how to use them in Python to query the data or to perform spatial joins. Finally, you will also learn in more detail about choropleth visualizations.

### Projecting and transforming geometries
In this chapter, we will take a deeper look into how the coordinates of the geometries are expressed based on their Coordinate Reference System (CRS). You will learn the importance of those reference systems and how to handle it in practice with GeoPandas. Further, you will also learn how to create new geometries based on the spatial relationships, which will allow you to overlay spatial datasets. And you will further practice this all with Paris datasets!

## [Image Processing with Keras in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-processing) (4 hours)
Deep learning methods use data to train neural network algorithms to do a variety of machine learning tasks, such as classification of different classes of objects. Convolutional neural networks are deep learning algorithms that are particularly powerful for analysis of images. This course will teach you how to construct, train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. You will also learn how to improve their ability to learn from data, and how to interpret the results of the training.

### Image Processing With Neural Networks
Convolutional neural networks use the data that is represented in images to learn. In this chapter, we will probe data in images, and we will learn how to use Keras to train a neural network to classify objects that appear in images.

According to Deloitte, 79% of organizations with high performing supply chains achieve revenue growth that is significantly above average. This course will introduce you to PuLP, a Linear Program optimization modeler written in Python. Using PuLP, the course will show you how to formulate and answer Supply Chain optimization questions such as where a production facility should be located, how to allocate production demand across different facilities, and more. We will explore the results of the models and their implications through sensitivity and simulation testing. This course will help you position yourself to improve the decision making of a supply chain by leveraging the power of Python and PuLP.

### Basics of supply chain optimization and PuLP
Linear Programming (LP) is a key technique for Supply Chain Optimization. The PuLP framework is an easy to use tool for working with LP problems and allows the programmer to focus on modeling. In this chapter we learn the basics of LP problems and start to learn how to use the PuLP framework to solve them.

### Solve and evaluate model
This chapter reviews some common mistakes made when creating constraints, and step through the process of solving the model. Once we have a solution to our LP model, how do we know if it is correct? In this chapter we also review a process for reasonableness checking or sanity checking the results. Furthermore, we continue working through our case study example on the Capacitated Plant location model by completing all the needed constraints.

###  Sensitivity and simulation testing of model
In our final chapter we review sensitivity analysis of constraints through shadow prices and slack. Additionally, we look at simulation testing our LP models. These different techniques allow us to answer different business-related questions about our models, such as available capacity and incremental costs. Finally, we complete our case study exercise and focus on using sensitivity analysis and simulation testing to answer questions about our model.

## [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/object-oriented-programming-in-python) (4 hours)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that reduces the complexity of systems as is employs heavy re-usability of code. OOP leverages the concept of objects and classes. Objects may contain data (known as attributes, stored as instance or class variables) as well as procedures (defined as methods). Objects are generated from blueprints known as classes, which specify the attributes and methods to be generated at the time of object instantiation. This course introduces the internals of classes and the utilization of objects, as well as important object-oriented programming fundamentals such as inheritance, polymorphism, and composition.

### Getting ready for object-oriented programming
In this chapter we quickly review functions and data structures, as they are building blocks of object-oriented programming. Then we transition into the conceptual definition of objects and classes.

### Inheritance, polymorphism and composition
In this chapter we cover inheritance, which is when we create a class that employs (or 'inherits') all class variables and methods from a 'parent' class. We also cover polymorphism, which is when multiple classes inherit from a single class. Finally, we cover composition, which is when classes employ specific class functionality from other classes without necessarily inheriting from them.

## [Customer Segmentation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/customer-segmentation-in-python) (4 hours)
The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this course, you will learn real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. You will first run cohort analysis to understand customer trends. You will then learn how to build easy to interpret customer segments. On top of that, you will prepare the segments you created, making them ready for machine learning. Finally, you will make your segments more powerful with k-means clustering, in just few lines of code! By the end of this course, you will be able to apply practical customer behavioral analytics and segmentation techniques.

### Cohort Analysis
In this first chapter, you will learn about cohorts and how to analyze them. You will create your own customer cohorts, get some metrics and visualize your results.

## [Analyzing US Census Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-python) (5 hours)
Data scientists in diverse fields, from marketing to public health to civic hacking, need to work with demographic and socioeconomic data. Government census agencies offer richly detailed, high-quality datasets, but the number of variables and intricacies of administrative geographies (what is a Census tract anyway?) can make approaching this goldmine a daunting process. This course will introduce you to the Decennial Census and the annual American Community Survey, and show you where to find data on household income, commuting, race, family structure, and other topics that may interest you. You will use Python to request this data using the Census API for large and small geographies. You will manipulate the data using pandas, and create derived data such as a measure of segregation. You will also get a taste of the mapping capabilities of geopandas.

### Decennial Census of Population and Housing
Start exploring Census data products with the Decennial Census. Use the Census API and the requests package to retrieve data, load into pandas data frames, and conduct exploratory visualization in seaborn. Learn about important Census geographies, including states, counties, and tracts.

## [Dimensionality Reduction in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/dimensionality-reduction-in-python) (4 hours)
High-dimensional datasets can be overwhelming and leave you not knowing where to start. Typically, you’d visually explore a new dataset first, but when you have too many dimensions the classical approaches will seem insufficient. Fortunately, there are visualization techniques designed specifically for high dimensional data and you’ll be introduced to these in this course. After exploring the data, you’ll often find that many features hold little information because they don’t show any variance or because they are duplicates of other features. You’ll learn how to detect these features and drop them from the dataset so that you can focus on the informative ones. In a next step, you might want to build a model on these features, and it may turn out that some don’t have any effect on the thing you’re trying to predict. You’ll learn how to detect and drop these irrelevant features too, in order to reduce dimensionality and thus complexity. Finally, you’ll learn how feature extraction techniques can reduce dimensionality for you through the calculation of uncorrelated principal components.

### Exploring high dimensional data
You'll be introduced to the concept of dimensionality reduction and will learn when an why this is important. You'll learn the difference between feature selection and feature extraction and will apply both techniques for data exploration.  The chapter ends with a lesson on t-SNE, a powerful feature extraction technique that will allow you to visualize a high-dimensional dataset.

### Feature selection I, selecting for feature information
In this first out of two chapters on feature selection, you'll learn about the curse of dimensionality and how dimensionality reduction can help you overcome it. You'll be introduced to a number of techniques to detect and remove features that bring little added value to the dataset. Either because they have little variance, too many missing values, or because they are strongly correlated to other features.

### Feature selection II, selecting for model accuracy
In this second chapter on feature selection, you'll learn how to let models help you find the most important features in a dataset for predicting a particular target feature. In the final lesson of this chapter, you'll combine the advice of multiple, different, models to decide on which features are worth keeping.

### Feature extraction
This chapter is a deep-dive on the most frequently used dimensionality reduction algorithm, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). You'll build intuition on how and why this algorithm is so powerful and will apply it both for data exploration and data pre-processing in a modeling pipeline.  You'll end with a cool image compression use case.

## [Working with Dates and Times in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-dates-and-times-in-python) (4 hours)
You'll probably never have a time machine, but how about a machine for analyzing time? As soon as time enters any analysis, things can get weird. It's easy to get tripped up on day and month boundaries, time zones, daylight saving time, and all sorts of other things that can confuse the unprepared. If you're going to do any kind of analysis involving time, you’ll want to use Python to sort it out. Working with data sets on hurricanes and bike trips, we’ll cover counting events, figuring out how much time has elapsed between events and plotting data over time. You'll work in both standard Python and in Pandas, and we'll touch on the dateutil library, the only timezone library endorsed by the official Python documentation. After this course, you'll confidently handle date and time data in any format like a champion.

### Dates and Calendars
Hurricanes (also known as cyclones or typhoons) hit the U.S. state of Florida several times per year. To start off this course, you'll learn how to work with date objects in Python, starting with the dates of every hurricane to hit Florida since 1950. You'll learn how Python handles dates, common date operations, and the right way to format dates to avoid confusion.

### Combining Dates and Times
Bike sharing programs have swept through cities around the world -- and luckily for us, every trip gets recorded! Working with all of the comings and goings of one bike in Washington, D.C., you'll practice working with dates and times together. You'll parse dates and times from text, analyze peak trip times, calculate ride durations, and more.

### Time Zones and Daylight Saving
In this chapter, you'll learn to confidently tackle the time-related topic that causes people the most trouble: time zones and daylight saving. Continuing with our bike data, you'll learn how to compare clocks around the world, how to gracefully handle "spring forward" and "fall back," and how to get up-to-date timezone data from the dateutil library.

### Easy and Powerful: Dates and Times in Pandas
To conclude this course, you'll apply everything you've learned about working with dates and times in standard Python to working with dates and times in Pandas. With additional information about each bike ride, such as what station it started and stopped at and whether or not the rider had a yearly membership, you'll be able to dig much more deeply into the bike trip data. In this chapter, you'll cover powerful Pandas operations, such as grouping and plotting results by time.

## [Designing Machine Learning Workflows in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/designing-machine-learning-workflows-in-python) (4 hours)
Deploying machine learning models in production seems easy with modern tools, but often ends in disappointment as the model performs worse in production than in development. This course will give you four superpowers that will make you stand out from the data science crowd and build pipelines that stand the test of time: how to exhaustively tune every aspect of your model in development; how to make the best possible use of available domain expertise; how to monitor your model in performance and deal with any performance deterioration; and finally how to deal with poorly or scarcely labelled data. Digging deep into the cutting edge of sklearn, and dealing with real-life datasets from hot areas like personalized healthcare and cybersecurity, this course reveals a view of machine learning from the frontline.

### The Standard Workflow
In this chapter, you will be reminded of the basics of a supervised learning workflow, complete with model fitting, tuning and selection, feature engineering and selection, and data splitting techniques. You will understand how these steps in a workflow depend on each other, and recognize how they can all contribute to, or fight against overfitting: the data scientist's worst enemy. By the end of the chapter, you will already be fluent in supervised learning, and ready to take the dive towards more advanced material in later chapters.

### The Human in the Loop
In the previous chapter, you perfected your knowledge of the standard supervised learning workflows. In this chapter, you will critically examine the ways in which expert knowledge is incorporated in supervised learning. This is done through the identification of the appropriate unit of analysis which might require feature engineering across multiple data sources, through the sometimes imperfect process of labeling examples, and through the specification of a loss function that captures the true business value of errors made by your machine learning model.

### Model Lifecycle Management
In the previous chapter, you employed different ways of incorporating feedback from experts in your workflow, and evaluating it in ways that are aligned with business value. Now it is time for you to practice the skills needed to productize your model and ensure it continues to perform well thereafter by iteratively improving it. You will also learn to diagnose dataset shift and mitigate the effect that a changing environment can have on your model's accuracy.

### Unsupervised Workflows
In the previous chapters you established a solid foundation in supervised learning, complete with knowledge of deploying models in production but always assumed you a labeled dataset would be available for your analysis. In this chapter, you take on the challenge of modeling data without any, or with very few, labels. This takes you into a journey into anomaly detection, a kind of unsupervised modeling, as well as distance-based learning, where beliefs about what constitutes similarity between two examples can be used in place of labels to help you achieve levels of accuracy comparable to a supervised workflow. Upon completing this chapter, you will clearly stand out from the crowd of data scientists in confidently knowing what tools to use to modify your workflow in order to overcome common real-world challenges.

## [Writing Efficient Python Code](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-efficient-python-code) (4 hours)
As a Data Scientist, the majority of your time should be spent gleaning actionable insights from data -- not waiting for your code to finish running. Writing efficient Python code can help reduce runtime and save computational resources, ultimately freeing you up to do the things you love as a Data Scientist. In this course, you'll learn how to use Python's built-in data structures, functions, and modules to write cleaner, faster, and more efficient code. We'll explore how to time and profile code in order to find bottlenecks. Then, you'll practice eliminating these bottlenecks, and other bad design patterns, using Python's Standard Library, NumPy, and pandas. After completing this course, you'll have the necessary tools to start writing efficient Python code!

### Foundations for efficiencies

## [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning-in-python) (4 hours)
Every day you read about the amazing breakthroughs in how the newest applications of machine learning are changing the world. Often this reporting glosses over the fact that a huge amount of data munging and feature engineering must be done before any of these fancy models can be used. In this course, you will learn how to do just that. You will work with Stack Overflow Developers survey, and historic US presidential inauguration addresses, to understand how best to preprocess and engineer features from categorical, continuous, and unstructured data. This course will give you hands-on experience on how to prepare any data for your own machine learning models.

### Creating Features
In this chapter, you will explore what feature engineering is and how to get started with applying it to real-world data. You will load, explore and visualize a survey response dataset, and in doing so you will learn about its underlying data types and why they have an influence on how you should engineer your features. Using the pandas package you will create new features from both categorical and continuous columns.

## [Foundations of Probability in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-python) (5 hours)
Probability is the study of regularities that emerge in the outcomes of random experiments. In this course, you'll learn about fundamental probability concepts like random variables (starting with the classic coin flip example) and how to calculate mean and variance, probability distributions, and conditional probability. We'll also explore two very important results in probability: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Since probability is at the core of data science and machine learning, these concepts will help you understand and apply models more robustly. Chances are everywhere, and the study of probability will change the way you see the world. Let’s get random!

### Let's start flipping coins
A coin flip is the classic example of a random experiment. The possible outcomes are heads or tails. This type of experiment, known as a Bernoulli or binomial trial, allows us to study problems with two possible outcomes, like “yes” or “no” and “vote” or “no vote.” This chapter introduces Bernoulli experiments, binomial distributions to model multiple Bernoulli trials, and probability simulations with the scipy library.

### Calculate some probabilities
In this chapter you'll learn to calculate various kinds of probabilities, such as the probability of the intersection of two events and the sum of probabilities of two events, and to simulate those situations. You'll also learn about conditional probability and how to apply Bayes' rule.

### Important probability distributions
Until now we've been working with binomial distributions, but there are many probability distributions a random variable can take. In this chapter we'll introduce three more that are related to the binomial distribution: the normal, Poisson, and geometric distributions.

### Probability meets statistics
No that you know how to calculate probabilities and important properties of probability distributions, we'll introduce two important results: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. This will expand your understanding on how the sample mean converges to the population mean as more data is available and how the sum of random variables behaves under certain conditions.

We will also explore connections between linear and logistic regressions as applications of probability and statistics in data science.

## [Optimizing Python Code with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/optimizing-python-code-with-pandas) (4 hours)
The ability to efficiently work with big datasets and extract valuable information is an indispensable tool for every aspiring data scientist. When working with a small amount of data, we often don’t realize how slow code execution can be. This course will build on your knowledge of Python and the pandas library and introduce you to efficient built-in pandas functions to perform tasks faster. Pandas’ built-in functions allow you to tackle the simplest tasks, like targeting specific entries and features from the data, to the most complex tasks, like applying functions on groups of entries, much faster than Python's usual methods. By the end of this course, you will be able to apply a function to data based on a feature value, iterate through big datasets rapidly, and manipulate data belonging to different groups efficiently. You will apply these methods on a variety of real-world datasets, such as poker hands or restaurant tips.

### Selecting columns and rows efficiently

## [Improving Your Data Visualizations in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/improving-your-data-visualizations-in-python) (4 hours)
Great data visualization is the cornerstone of impactful data science. Visualization helps you to both find insight in your data and share those insights with your audience. Everyone learns how to make a basic scatter plot or bar chart on their journey to becoming a data scientist, but the true potential of data visualization is realized when you take a step back and think about what, why, and how you are visualizing your data. In this course you will learn how to construct compelling and attractive visualizations that help you communicate the results of your analyses efficiently and effectively. We will cover comparing data, the ins and outs of color, showing uncertainty, and how to build the right visualization for your given audience through the investigation of a datasets on air pollution around the US and farmer's markets. We will finish the course by examining open-access farmers market data to build a polished and impactful visual report.

### Highlighting your data
How do you show all of your data while making sure that viewers don't miss an important point or points? Here we discuss how to guide your viewer through the data with color-based highlights and text. We also introduce a dataset on common pollutant values across the United States.

### Showing uncertainty
Uncertainty occurs everywhere in data science, but it's frequently left out of visualizations where it should be included. Here, we review what a confidence interval is and how to visualize them for both single estimates and continuous functions. Additionally, we discuss the bootstrap resampling technique for assessing uncertainty and how to visualize it properly.

## [Clustering Methods with SciPy](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/clustering-methods-with-scipy) (4 hours)
You have probably come across Google News, which automatically groups similar news articles under a topic. Have you ever wondered what process runs in the background to arrive at these groups? In this course, you will be introduced to unsupervised learning through clustering using the SciPy library in Python. This course covers pre-processing of data and application of hierarchical and k-means clustering. Through the course, you will explore player statistics from a popular football video game, FIFA 18. After completing the course, you will be able to quickly apply various clustering algorithms on data, visualize the clusters formed and analyze results.

### Introduction to Clustering
Before you are ready to classify news articles, you need to be introduced to the basics of clustering. This chapter familiarizes you with a class of machine learning algorithms called unsupervised learning and then introduces you to clustering, one of the popular unsupervised learning algorithms. You will know about two popular clustering techniques - hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering. The chapter concludes with basic pre-processing steps before you start clustering data.

### K-Means Clustering
This chapter introduces a different clustering algorithm - k-means clustering - and its implementation in SciPy. K-means clustering overcomes the biggest drawback of hierarchical clustering that was discussed in the last chapter. As dendrograms are specific to hierarchical clustering, this chapter discusses one method to find the number of clusters before running k-means clustering. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the limitations of k-means clustering and discusses considerations while using this algorithm.

## [Machine Learning with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-apache-spark) (4 hours)
Spark is a powerful, general purpose tool for working with Big Data. Spark transparently handles the distribution of compute tasks across a cluster. This means that operations are fast, but it also allows you to focus on the analysis rather than worry about technical details. In this course you'll learn how to get data into Spark and then delve into the three fundamental Spark Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression/Classifiers, and creating pipelines. Along the way you'll analyse a large dataset of flight delays and spam text messages. With this background you'll be ready to harness the power of Spark and apply it on your own Machine Learning projects!

### Introduction
Spark is a framework for working with Big Data. In this chapter you'll cover some background about Spark and Machine Learning. You'll then find out how to connect to Spark using Python and load CSV data.

## [Introduction to Spark SQL in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-spark-sql) (4 hours)
You're familiar with SQL, and have heard great things about Apache Spark. Then this course is for you! Apache Spark is a computing framework for processing big data. Spark SQL is a component of Apache Spark that works with tabular data. Window functions are an advanced feature of SQL that take Spark to a new level of usefulness.  You will use Spark SQL to analyze time series.  You will extract the most common sequences of words from a text document. You will create feature sets from natural language text and use them to predict the last word in a sentence using logistic regression. Spark combines the power of distributed computing with the ease of use of Python and SQL.

The course uses a natural language text dataset that is easy to understand. Sentences are sequences of words. Window functions are very suitable for manipulating sequence data. The same techniques taught here can be applied to sequences of song identifiers, video ids, or podcast ids.  Exercises include discovering frequent word sequences, and converting word sequences into machine learning feature set data for training a text classifier.

### Pyspark SQL
In this chapter you will learn how to create and query a SQL table in Spark.  Spark SQL brings the expressiveness of SQL to Spark.  You will also learn how to use SQL window functions in Spark.  Window functions perform a calculation across rows that are related to the current row.  They greatly simplify achieving results that are difficult to express using only joins and traditional aggregations.  We'll use window functions to perform running sums, running differences, and other operations that are challenging to perform in basic SQL.

### Caching, Logging, and the Spark UI
In the previous chapters you learned how to use the expressiveness of window function SQL.  However, this expressiveness now makes it important that you understand how to properly cache dataframes and cache SQL tables.  It is also important to know how to evaluate your application.  You learn how to do do this using the Spark UI.  You'll also learn a best practice for logging in Spark. Spark SQL brings with it another useful tool for tuning query performance issues, the query execution plan. You will learn how to use the execution plan for evaluating the provenance of a dataframe.

## [Introduction to TensorFlow in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-tensorflow-in-python) (4 hours)
Not long ago, cutting-edge computer vision algorithms couldn’t differentiate between images of cats and dogs. Today, a skilled data scientist equipped with nothing more than a laptop can classify tens of thousands of objects with greater accuracy than the human eye. In this course, you will use TensorFlow 2.0 to develop, train, and make predictions with the models that have powered major advances in recommendation systems, image classification, and FinTech. You will learn both high-level APIs, which will enable you to design and train deep learning models in 15 lines of code, and low-level APIs, which will allow you to move beyond off-the-shelf routines. You will also learn to accurately predict housing prices, credit card borrower defaults, and images of sign language gestures.

### Introduction to TensorFlow
Before you can build advanced models in TensorFlow 2.0, you will first need to understand the basics. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to define constants and variables, perform tensor addition and multiplication, and compute derivatives.

## [Model Validation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/model-validation-in-python) (4 hours)
Machine learning models are easier to implement now more than ever before. Without proper validation, the results of running new data through a model might not be as accurate as expected. Model validation allows analysts to confidently answer the question, how good is your model? We will answer this question for classification models using the complete set of tic-tac-toe endgame scenarios, and for regression models using fivethirtyeight’s ultimate Halloween candy power ranking dataset. In this course, we will cover the basics of model validation, discuss various validation techniques, and begin to develop tools for creating validated and high performing models.

### Basic Modeling in scikit-learn
Before we can validate models, we need an understanding of how to create and work with them. This chapter provides an introduction to running regression and classification models in scikit-learn. We will use this model building foundation throughout the remaining chapters.

### Cross Validation
Holdout sets are a great start to model validation. However, using a single train and test set if often not enough. Cross-validation is considered the gold standard when it comes to validating model performance and is almost always used when tuning model hyper-parameters. This chapter focuses on performing cross-validation to validate model performance.

### Visualizing Two Quantitative Variables
In this chapter, you will create and customize plots that visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables. To do this, you will use scatter plots and line plots to explore how the level of air pollution in a city changes over the course of a day and how horsepower relates to fuel efficiency in cars. You will also see another big advantage of using Seaborn - the ability to easily create subplots in a single figure!

## [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
How do we get from data to answers?  Exploratory data analysis is a process for exploring datasets, answering questions, and visualizing results.  This course presents the tools you need to clean and validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression models to predict and explain.  You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey.  But the methods you learn apply to all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization.  With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real data, make discoveries, and present compelling results.

### Read, clean, and validate
The first step of almost any data project is to read the data, check for errors and special cases, and prepare data for analysis. This is exactly what you'll do in this chapter, while working with a dataset obtained from the National Survey of Family Growth.

### Distributions
In the first chapter, having cleaned and validated your data, you began exploring it by using histograms to visualize distributions. In this chapter, you'll learn how to represent distributions using Probability Mass Functions (PMFs) and Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs). You'll learn when to use each of them, and why, while working with a new dataset obtained from the General Social Survey.

### Relationships
Up until this point, you've only looked at one variable at a time. In this chapter, you'll explore relationships between variables two at a time, using scatter plots and other visualizations to extract insights from a new dataset obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). You'll also learn how to quantify those relationships using correlation and simple regression.

## [Generalized Linear Models in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/generalized-linear-models-in-python) (5 hours)
Imagine being able to handle data where the response variable is either binary, count, or approximately normal, all under one single framework. Well, you don't have to imagine. Enter the Generalized Linear Models in Python course! In this course you will extend your regression toolbox with the logistic and Poisson models, by learning how to fit, understand, assess model performance and finally use the model to make predictions on new data. You will practice using data from real world studies such the largest population poisoning in world's history, nesting of horseshoe crabs and counting the bike crossings on the bridges in New York City.

### Introduction to GLMs
Review linear models and learn how GLMs are an extension of the linear model given different types of response variables. You will also learn the building blocks of GLMs and the technical process of fitting a GLM in Python.

## [Unit Testing for Data Science in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/unit-testing-for-data-science-in-python) (4 hours)
Every data science project needs unit testing. It comes with huge benefits - saving a lot of development and maintenance time, improving documentation, increasing end-user trust and reducing downtime of productive systems. As a result, unit testing has become a must-have skill in the industry, used by almost every company. This course teaches unit testing in Python using the most popular testing framework pytest. By the end of this course, you will have written a complete test suite for a data science project. In the process, you will learn to write unit tests for data preprocessors, models and visualizations, interpret test results and fix any buggy code. You will also learn advanced concepts like TDD, test organization, fixtures and mocking so that you can test your own data science projects properly.

### Unit testing basics
In this chapter, you will get introduced to the pytest package and use it to write simple unit tests. You'll run the tests, interpret the test result reports and fix bugs. Throughout the chapter, we will use examples exclusively from the data preprocessing module of a linear regression project, making sure you learn unit testing in the context of data science.

### Intermediate unit testing
In this chapter, you will write more advanced unit tests. Starting from testing complicated data types like NumPy arrays to testing exception handling, you'll do it all. Once you have mastered the science of testing, we will also focus on the arts. For example, we will learn how to find the balance between writing too many tests and too few tests.  In the last lesson, you will get introduced to a radically new programming methodology called Test Driven Development (TDD) and put it to practice. This might actually change the way you code forever!

## [Analyzing IoT Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-iot-data-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever heard about Internet of Things devices? Of course, you have. Maybe you also have a Raspberry PI in your house monitoring the temperature and humidity.
  IoT devices are everywhere around us, collecting data about our environment.
  You will be analyzing Environmental data, Traffic data as well as energy counter data.
  Following the course, you will learn how to collect and store data from a data stream.
  You will prepare IoT data for analysis, analyze and visualize IoT data, before  implementing
  a simple machine learning model to take action when certain events occur and deploy this model
  to a real-time data stream.

### Accessing IoT Data
In this chapter, you will first understand what IoT data is.
Then, you learn how to aquire IoT data through a REST API and using an MQTT data stream to collect data in real time.

## [Preparing for Coding Interview Questions in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preparing-for-coding-interview-questions-in-python) (4 hours)
Coding interviews can be challenging. You might be asked questions to test your knowledge of a programming language. On the other side, you can be given a task to solve in order to check how you think. And when you are interviewed for a data scientist position, it's likely you can be asked on the corresponding tools available for the language. In either of the cases, to get a cool position as a data scientist, you need to do a little work to perform the best. That's why it's very important to practice in order to prove your expertise! This course serves as a guide for those who just start their path to become a professional data scientist and as a refresher for those who seek for other opportunities. We'll go through fundamental as well as advanced topics that aim to prepare you for a coding interview in Python. Since it is not a normal step-by-step course, some exercises can be quite complex. But who said that interviews are easy to pass, right?

### Python Data Structures and String Manipulation
In this chapter, we'll refresh our knowledge of the main data structures used in Python.  We'll cover how to deal with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.  We'll also consider strings and how to write regular expressions to retrieve specific character sequences from a given text.

### Iterable objects and representatives
This chapter focuses on iterable objects. We'll refresh the definition of iterable objects and explain, how to identify one.  Next, we'll cover list comprehensions, which is a very special feature of Python programming language to define lists.  Then, we'll recall how to combine several iterable objects into one. Finally, we'll cover how to create custom iterable objects using generators.

### Functions and lambda expressions
This chapter will focus on the functional aspects of Python. We'll start by defining functions with a variable amount of positional as well as keyword arguments.  Next, we'll cover lambda functions and in which cases they can be helpful. Especially, we'll see how to use them with such functions as map(), filter(), and reduce(). Finally, we'll recall what is recursion and how to correctly implement one.

## [Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/deep-learning-with-keras-in-python) (4 hours)
Deep learning is here to stay! It's the go-to technique to solve complex problems that arise with unstructured data and an incredible tool for innovation. Keras is one of the frameworks that make it easier to start developing deep learning models, and it's versatile enough to build industry-ready models in no time. In this course, you will learn regression and save the earth by predicting asteroid trajectories, apply binary classification to distinguish between real and fake dollar bills, use multiclass classification to decide who threw which dart at a dart board, learn to use neural networks to reconstruct noisy images and much more. Additionally, you will learn how to better control your models during training and how to tune them to boost their performance.

### Introducing Keras
In this first chapter, you will get introduced to neural networks, understand what kind of problems they can solve, and when to use them. You will also build several networks and save the earth by training a regression model that approximates the orbit of a meteor that is approaching us!

## [Experimental Design in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/experimental-design-in-python) (4 hours)
Data is all around us and can help us to understand many things. Making a pretty graph is great, but how can we tell the difference between a few outliers on a graph and a real, reliable effect? Is a trend that we see on a graph a reliable result or just random chance playing tricks? In this course, you will learn how to interrogate datasets in a rigorous way, giving clear answers to your questions. You will learn a range of statistical tests, how to apply them, how to understand their results, and how to deal with their shortcomings. Along the way, you will explore Olympic athlete data and the differences between populations of continents.

### The Basics of Statistical Hypothesis Testing
In this chapter, you will learn how to explore your data and ask meaningful questions. Then, you will discover how to answer these question by using your first statistical hypothesis tests: the t-test, the Chi-Square test, the Fisher exact test, and the Pearson correlation test.

## [Streamlined Data Ingestion with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/streamlined-data-ingestion-with-pandas) (4 hours)
Before you can analyze data, you first have to acquire it. This course teaches you how to build pipelines to import data kept in common storage formats. You’ll use pandas, a major Python library for analytics, to get data from a variety of sources, from spreadsheets of survey responses, to a database of public service requests, to an API for a popular review site. Along the way, you’ll learn how to fine-tune imports to get only what you need and to address issues like incorrect data types. Finally, you’ll assemble a custom dataset from a mix of sources.

### Importing Data from Flat Files

## [Sentiment Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/sentiment-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you left a review to express how you feel about a product or a service? And do you have a habit of checking a product’s reviews online before you buy it? This kind of information is valuable not only for you but also for companies. In this course, you will learn how to make sense of the sentiment expressed in various documents. You will use real-world datasets featuring tweets, movie and product reviews, and use Python’s nltk and scikit-learn packages. By the end of the course, you will be able to carry an end-to-end sentiment analysis task based on how US airline passengers expressed their feelings on Twitter.

### Sentiment Analysis Nuts and Bolts
Have you ever checked the reviews or ratings of a product or a service before you purchased it? Then you have very likely came face-to-face with sentiment analysis. In this chapter,  you will learn the basic structure of a sentiment analysis problem and start exploring the sentiment of movie reviews.

### Sequence to Sequence Models
This chapter introduces you to two applications of RNN models: Text Generation and Neural Machine Translation.  You will learn how to prepare the text data to the format needed by the models.
The Text Generation model is used for replicating a character's way of speech and will have some fun mimicking Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory. 
Neural Machine Translation is used for example by Google Translate in a much more complex model. In this chapter, you will create a model that translates Portuguese small phrases into English.

## [Machine Translation in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-translation-in-python) (4 hours)
The need to pack a bilingual dictionary for your European holiday or keeping one on your desk to complete your foreign language homework is a thing of the past. You just hop on the internet and make use of a language translation service to quickly understand what the street sign means or finding out how to greet and thank a foreigner in their language. Behind the language translation services are complex machine translation models. Have you ever wondered how these models work? This course will allow you to explore the inner workings of a machine translation model. You will use Keras, a powerful Python-based deep learning library, to implement a translation model. You will then train the model to perform an English to French translation, and you will be shown techniques to improve your model. At the end of this course, you would have developed an in-depth understanding of machine translation models and appreciate them even more!

## [Spoken Language Processing in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/spoken-language-processing-in-python) (4 hours)
We learn to speak far before we learn to read. Even in the digital age, our main method of communication is speech. Spoken Language Processing with Python will help you load, transform and transcribe audio files. You'll start by seeing what raw audio looks like in Python. And then finish by working through an example business use case, transcribing and classifying phone call data.

### Introduction to Spoken Language Processing with Python
Audio files are different from most other types of data. Before you can start working with them, they require some preprocessing. In this chapter, you'll learn the first steps to working with speech files by converting two different audio files into soundwaves and comparing them visually.

### Manipulating Audio Files with PyDub
Not all audio files come in the same shape, size or format. Luckily, the PyDub library by James Robert provides tools which you can use to programmatically alter and change different audio file attributes such as frame rate, number of channels, file format and more. In this chapter, you'll learn how to use this helpful library to ensure all of your audio files are in the right shape for transcription.

## [Building Data Engineering Pipelines in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-data-engineering-pipelines-in-python) (4 hours)
In any data-driven company, you will undoubtedly cross paths with data engineers. Among other things, they facilitate some of your work by making data readily available to everyone within the organization, and possibly in bringing machine learning models into production. One way to speed up this process is through building an understanding of what it means to bring processes into production and what features are of high-grade code. In this course, we’ll be looking at various data pipelines the data engineer is building, and how some of the tools he or she is using can help you in getting your models into production or run repetitive tasks consistently and efficiently.
<br /> <br />
In this course, we illustrate common elements of data engineering pipelines. In Chapter 1, you will learn how to ingest data. Chapter 2 will go one step further with cleaning and transforming data. In Chapter 3, you will learn how to safely deploy code. Finally, in Chapter 4 you will schedule complex dependencies between applications.
<br /> <br />
<i>Building Data Engineering Pipelines covers new technologies and material, so we recommend that you have a strong understanding of the prerequisites to get the most out of this course.</i>

### Ingesting Data
After seeing this chapter, you will be able to explain what a data platform is, how data ends up in it, and how data engineers structure its foundations. You will be able to ingest data from a RESTful API into the data platform’s data lake using a self-written ingestion pipeline, made using Singer’s taps and targets.

### Testing your data pipeline
Stating “it works on my machine” is not a guarantee it will work reliably elsewhere and in the future. Requirements for your project will change. In this chapter, we explore different forms of testing and learn how to write unit tests for our PySpark data transformation pipeline, so that we make robust and reusable parts.

## [Introduction to Portfolio Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-portfolio-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever had wondered whether an investment fund is actually a good investment? Or compared two investment options and asked what the difference between the two is? What does the risk indicator of these funds even mean? Or do you frequently work with financial data in your daily job and you want to get an edge? In this course, you’re going to get familiar with the exciting world of investing, by learning about portfolios, risk and return, and how to critically analyze them. By working on actual historical stock data, you’ll learn how to calculate meaningful measures of risk, how to break-down performance, and how to calculate an optimal portfolio for the desired risk and return trade-off. After this course, you’ll be able to make data-driven decisions when it comes to investing and have a better understanding of investment portfolios.

### Introduction to Portfolio Analysis
In the first chapter, you’ll learn how a portfolio is build up out of individual assets and corresponding weights. The chapter also covers how to calculate the main characteristics of a portfolio: returns and risk.

### Risk and Return
Chapter 2 goes deeper into how to measure returns and risk accurately. The two most important measures of return, annualized returns, and risk-adjusted returns, are covered in the first part of the chapter. In the second part, you’ll learn how to look at risk from different perspectives. This part focuses on skewness and kurtosis of a distribution, as well as downside risk.

## [Credit Risk Modeling in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/credit-risk-modeling-in-python) (4 hours)
If you've ever applied for a credit card or loan, you know that financial firms process your information before making a decision.  This is because giving you a loan can have a serious financial impact on their business.  But how do they make a decision?  In this course, you will learn how to prepare credit application data.  After that, you will apply machine learning and business rules to reduce risk and ensure profitability.  You will use two data sets that emulate real credit applications while focusing on business value. Join me and learn the expected value of credit risk modeling!

### Exploring and Preparing Loan Data
In this first chapter, we will discuss the concept of credit risk and define how it is calculated.  Using cross tables and plots, we will explore a real-world data set.  Before applying machine learning, we will process this data by finding and resolving problems.

### Logistic Regression for Defaults
With the loan data fully prepared, we will discuss the logistic regression model which is a standard in risk modeling.  We will understand the components of this model as well as how to score its performance.   Once we've created predictions, we can explore the financial impact of utilizing this model.

## [Machine Learning for Marketing in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-for-marketing-in-python) (4 hours)
The rise of machine learning (almost sounds like "rise of the machines"?) and applications of statistical methods to marketing have changed the field forever. Machine learning is being used to optimize customer journeys which maximize their satisfaction and lifetime value. This course will give you the foundational tools which you can immediately apply to improve your company’s marketing strategy. You will learn how to use different techniques to predict customer churn and interpret its drivers, measure, and forecast customer lifetime value, and finally, build customer segments based on their product purchase patterns. You will use customer data from a telecom company to predict churn, construct a recency-frequency-monetary dataset from an online retailer for customer lifetime value prediction, and build customer segments from product purchase data from a grocery shop.

### Machine learning for marketing basics
In this chapter, you will explore the basics of machine learning methods used in marketing. You will learn about different types of machine learning, data preparation steps, and will run several end to end models to understand their power.

## [Preparing for Machine Learning Interview Questions in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/preparing-for-machine-learning-interview-questions-in-python) (4 hours)
Have you ever wondered how to properly prepare for a Machine Learning Interview? Of course you have or you likely wouldn't be reading this right now! In this course, students will prepare to answer 15 common Machine Learning (ML) interview questions for a data scientist role in Python. These questions will revolve around 7 important topics: data preprocessing, data visualization, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, model ensembling, model selection, and model evaluation. By the end of the course, the students will possess both the required theoretical background and the ability to develop Python code to successfully answer these 15 questions. The coding examples will be mainly based on the scikit-learn package given its ease-of-use and ability to cover the most important ML techniques in the Python language.
<br /> <br />
<i>The course does not teach machine learning fundamentals as these are covered in the course's prerequisites.</i>

## [Pandas Joins for Spreadsheet Users](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-joins-for-spreadsheet-users) (4 hours)
Joining two or more datasets is necessary for almost any real-world analysis. You’ve done it before with spreadsheets using VLOOKUP and related functions. Can you build on this experience as you transition to the world of Python? Yes! In this course you will learn the ins and outs of bringing datasets together with pandas, Python’s gold standard for manipulating tabular data. You’ll apply pandas functions to combine data from the National Football League (NFL) framed in a familiar spreadsheet environment. Armed with these skills you will be able to harness the power of pandas and integrate larger, more complex datasets into any analysis.

### Introduction to joining data
In this chapter, we'll build a foundation for using pandas to join data. You'll learn about the types of joins and how pandas can improve your effectiveness and productivity.
