### List comprehensions and generators
In this chapter, you'll build on your knowledge of iterators and be introduced to list comprehensions, which allow you to create complicated lists—and lists of lists—in one line of code! List comprehensions can dramatically simplify your code and make it more efficient, and will become a vital part of your Python data science toolbox. You'll then learn about generators, which are extremely helpful when working with large sequences of data that you may not want to store in memory, but instead generate on the fly.

## [Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/python-data-science-toolbox-part-1) (3 hours)
It's time to push forward and develop your Python chops even further. There are tons of fantastic functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, as a data scientist, you'll constantly need to write your own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. You will learn the art of function writing in this first Python Data Science Toolbox course. You'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. You'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice. And you'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames.

### Writing your own functions
In this chapter, you'll learn how to write simple functions, as well as functions that accept multiple arguments and return multiple values. You'll also have the opportunity to apply these new skills to questions commonly encountered by data scientists.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-1) (3 hours)
After all of the hard work of acquiring data and getting them into a form you can work with, you ultimately want to make clear, succinct conclusions from them. This crucial last step of a data analysis pipeline hinges on the principles of statistical inference. In this course, you will start building the foundation you need to think statistically, speak the language of your data, and understand what your data is telling you. The foundations of statistical thinking took decades to build, but can be grasped much faster today with the help of computers. With the power of Python-based tools, you will rapidly get up-to-speed and begin thinking statistically by the end of this course.

### Graphical exploratory data analysis
Before diving into sophisticated statistical inference techniques, you should first explore your data by plotting them and computing simple summary statistics. This process, called exploratory data analysis, is a crucial first step in statistical analysis of data.

### Thinking probabilistically-- Discrete variables
Statistical inference rests upon probability. Because we can very rarely say anything meaningful with absolute certainty from data, we use probabilistic language to make quantitative statements about data. In this chapter, you will learn how to think probabilistically about discrete quantities: those that can only take certain values, like integers.

### Thinking probabilistically-- Continuous variables
It’s time to move onto continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties. At the end of this final chapter, you will be speaking the probabilistic language you need to launch into the inference techniques covered in the sequel to this course.

## [Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2) (4 hours)
After completing Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1), you have the probabilistic mindset and foundational hacker stats skills to dive into data sets and extract useful information from them. In this course, you will do just that, expanding and honing your hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will work with real data sets as you learn, culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches. You will emerge from this course with new knowledge and lots of practice under your belt, ready to attack your own inference problems out in the world.

### Parameter estimation by optimization
When doing statistical inference, we speak the language of probability. A probability distribution that describes your data has parameters. So, a major goal of statistical inference is to estimate the values of these parameters, which allows us to concisely and unambiguously describe our data and draw conclusions from it. In this chapter, you will learn how to find the optimal parameters, those that best describe your data.

### Bootstrap confidence intervals
To "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" is a classic idiom meaning that you achieve a difficult task by yourself with no help at all. In statistical inference, you want to know what would happen if you could repeat your data acquisition an infinite number of times. This task is impossible, but can we use only the data we actually have to get close to the same result as an infinitude of experiments? The answer is yes! The technique to do it is aptly called bootstrapping. This chapter will introduce you to this extraordinarily powerful tool.

### Introduction to hypothesis testing
You now know how to define and estimate parameters given a model. But the question remains: how reasonable is it to observe your data if a model is true? This question is addressed by hypothesis tests. They are the icing on the inference cake. After completing this chapter, you will be able to carefully construct and test hypotheses using hacker statistics.

### Hypothesis test examples
As you saw from the last chapter, hypothesis testing can be a bit tricky. You need to define the null hypothesis, figure out how to simulate it, and define clearly what it means to be "more extreme" in order to compute the p-value. Like any skill, practice makes perfect, and this chapter gives you some good practice with hypothesis tests.

### Putting it all together: a case study
Every year for the past 40-plus years, Peter and Rosemary Grant have gone to the Galápagos island of Daphne Major and collected data on Darwin's finches. Using your skills in statistical inference, you will spend this chapter with their data, and witness first hand, through data, evolution in action. It's an exhilarating way to end the course!

## [Merging DataFrames with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/merging-dataframes-with-pandas) (4 hours)
As a data scientist, you'll often find that the data you need is not in a single file. It may be spread across a number of text files, spreadsheets, or databases. You’ll want to be able to import the data you’re interested in as a collection of DataFrames and combine them to answer your central questions. This course is all about the act of combining—or merging—DataFrames, an essential part of any data scientist's toolbox. You'll hone your pandas skills by learning how to organize, reshape, and aggregate multiple datasets to answer your specific questions.

### Preparing data
In this chapter, you'll learn about different techniques you can use to import multiple files into DataFrames. Having imported your data into individual DataFrames, you'll then learn how to share information between DataFrames using their indexes. Understanding how indexes work is essential to merging DataFrames, which you’ll learn later in the course.

## [Cleaning Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python) (4 hours)
A vital component of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. It is commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it. This course will equip you with all the skills you need to clean your data in Python, from learning how to diagnose problems in your data, to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, you'll apply all of the techniques you've learned to a case study to clean a real-world Gapminder dataset.

### Exploring your data
Say you've just gotten your hands on a brand new dataset and are itching to start exploring it. But where do you begin, and how can you be sure your dataset is clean? This chapter will introduce you to data cleaning in Python. You'll learn how to explore your data with an eye for diagnosing issues such as outliers, missing values, and duplicate rows.

### Combining data for analysis
The ability to transform and combine your data is a crucial skill in data science, because your data may not always come in one monolithic file or table for you to load. A large dataset may be broken into separate datasets to facilitate easier storage and sharing. But it's important to be able to run your analysis on a single dataset. You'll need to learn how to combine datasets or clean each dataset separately so you can combine them later for analysis.

### Cleaning data for analysis
Dive into some of the grittier aspects of data cleaning. Learn about string manipulation and pattern matching to deal with unstructured data, and then explore techniques to deal with missing or duplicate data. You'll also learn the valuable skill of programmatically checking your data for consistency, which will give you confidence that your code is running correctly and that the results of your analysis are reliable.

## [Case Studies in Statistical Thinking](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/case-studies-in-statistical-thinking) (4 hours)
Mastery requires practice. Having completed Statistical Thinking I and II, you developed your probabilistic mindset and the hacker stats skills to extract actionable insights from your data. Your foundation is in place, and now it is time practice your craft.

In this course, you will apply your statistical thinking skills, exploratory data analysis, parameter estimation, and hypothesis testing, to two new real-world data sets. First, you will explore data from the 2013 and 2015 FINA World Aquatics Championships, where you will quantify the relative speeds and variability among swimmers. You will then perform a statistical analysis to assess the "current controversy" of the 2013 Worlds in which swimmers claimed that a slight current in the pool was affecting result. Second, you will study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes around the world. Finally, you will analyze the changes in seismicity in the US state of Oklahoma after the practice of high pressure waste water injection at oil extraction sites became commonplace in the last decade. As you work with these data sets, you will take vital steps toward mastery as you cement your existing knowledge and broaden your abilities to use statistics and Python to make sense of your data.

### Statistical seismology and the Parkfield region
Herein, you'll use your statistical thinking skills to study the frequency and magnitudes of earthquakes. Along the way, you'll learn some basic statistical seismology, including the Gutenberg-Richter law. This exercise exposes two key ideas about data science: 1) As a data scientist, you wander into all sorts of domain specific analyses, which is very exciting. You constantly get to learn. 2) You are sometimes faced with limited data, which is also the case for many of these earthquake studies. You can still make good progress!

## [Visualizing Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
One of the most important tasks of a data scientist is to understand the relationships between their data's physical location and their geographical context. In this course you'll be learning to make attractive visualizations of geospatial data with the GeoPandas package. You will learn to spatially join datasets, linking data to context. Finally you will learn to overlay geospatial data to maps to add even more spatial cues to your work. You will use several datasets from the City of Nashville's open data portal to find out where the chickens are in Nashville, which neighborhood has the most public art, and more!

### Building 2-layer maps : combining polygons and scatterplots
In this chapter, you will learn how to create a two-layer map by first plotting regions from a shapefile and then plotting location points as a scatterplot.

## [Web Scraping in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/web-scraping-with-python) (4 hours)
The ability to build tools capable of retrieving and parsing information stored across the internet has been and continues to be valuable in many veins of data science. In this course, you will learn to navigate and parse html code, and build tools to crawl websites automatically. Although our scraping will be conducted using the versatile Python library scrapy, many of the techniques you learn in this course can be applied to other popular Python libraries as well, including BeautifulSoup and Selenium. Upon the completion of this course, you will have a strong mental model of html structure, will be able to build tools to parse html code and access desired information, and create a simple scrapy spiders to crawl the web at scale.

### Introduction to HTML
Learn the structure of HTML. We begin by explaining why web scraping can be a valuable addition to your data science toolbox and then delving into some basics of HTML. We end the chapter by giving a brief introduction on XPath notation, which is used to navigate the elements within HTML code.

## [Working with Geospatial Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-geospatial-data-in-python) (4 hours)
A good proportion of the data out there in the real world is inherently spatial. From the population recorded in the national census, to every shop in your neighborhood, the majority of datasets have a location aspect that you can exploit to make the most of what they have to offer. This course will show you how to integrate spatial data into your Python Data Science workflow. You will learn how to interact with, manipulate and augment real-world data using their geographic dimension. You will learn to read tabular spatial data in the most common formats (e.g. GeoJSON, shapefile, geopackage) and visualize them in maps. You will then combine different sources using their location as the bridge that puts them in relation to each other. And, by the end of the course, you will be able to understand what makes geographic data unique, allowing you to transform and repurpose them in different contexts.

### Introduction to geospatial vector data
In this chapter, you will be introduced to the concepts of geospatial data, and more specifically of vector data. You will then learn how to represent such data in Python using the GeoPandas library, and the basics to read, explore and visualize such data. And you will exercise all this with some datasets about the city of Paris.

### Spatial relationships
One of the key aspects of geospatial data is how they relate to each other in space. In this chapter, you will learn the different spatial relationships, and how to use them in Python to query the data or to perform spatial joins. Finally, you will also learn in more detail about choropleth visualizations.

### Projecting and transforming geometries
In this chapter, we will take a deeper look into how the coordinates of the geometries are expressed based on their Coordinate Reference System (CRS). You will learn the importance of those reference systems and how to handle it in practice with GeoPandas. Further, you will also learn how to create new geometries based on the spatial relationships, which will allow you to overlay spatial datasets. And you will further practice this all with Paris datasets!

## [Analyzing US Census Data in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-python) (5 hours)
Data scientists in diverse fields, from marketing to public health to civic hacking, need to work with demographic and socioeconomic data. Government census agencies offer richly detailed, high-quality datasets, but the number of variables and intricacies of administrative geographies (what is a Census tract anyway?) can make approaching this goldmine a daunting process. This course will introduce you to the Decennial Census and the annual American Community Survey, and show you where to find data on household income, commuting, race, family structure, and other topics that may interest you. You will use Python to request this data using the Census API for large and small geographies. You will manipulate the data using pandas, and create derived data such as a measure of segregation. You will also get a taste of the mapping capabilities of geopandas.

### Decennial Census of Population and Housing
Start exploring Census data products with the Decennial Census. Use the Census API and the requests package to retrieve data, load into pandas data frames, and conduct exploratory visualization in seaborn. Learn about important Census geographies, including states, counties, and tracts.

## [Foundations of Probability in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-python) (5 hours)
Probability is the study of regularities that emerge in the outcomes of random experiments. In this course, you'll learn about fundamental probability concepts like random variables (starting with the classic coin flip example) and how to calculate mean and variance, probability distributions, and conditional probability. We'll also explore two very important results in probability: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. Since probability is at the core of data science and machine learning, these concepts will help you understand and apply models more robustly. Chances are everywhere, and the study of probability will change the way you see the world. Let’s get random!

### Let's start flipping coins
A coin flip is the classic example of a random experiment. The possible outcomes are heads or tails. This type of experiment, known as a Bernoulli or binomial trial, allows us to study problems with two possible outcomes, like “yes” or “no” and “vote” or “no vote.” This chapter introduces Bernoulli experiments, binomial distributions to model multiple Bernoulli trials, and probability simulations with the scipy library.

### Calculate some probabilities
In this chapter you'll learn to calculate various kinds of probabilities, such as the probability of the intersection of two events and the sum of probabilities of two events, and to simulate those situations. You'll also learn about conditional probability and how to apply Bayes' rule.

### Important probability distributions
Until now we've been working with binomial distributions, but there are many probability distributions a random variable can take. In this chapter we'll introduce three more that are related to the binomial distribution: the normal, Poisson, and geometric distributions.

### Probability meets statistics
No that you know how to calculate probabilities and important properties of probability distributions, we'll introduce two important results: the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem. This will expand your understanding on how the sample mean converges to the population mean as more data is available and how the sum of random variables behaves under certain conditions.

We will also explore connections between linear and logistic regressions as applications of probability and statistics in data science.

## [Optimizing Python Code with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/optimizing-python-code-with-pandas) (4 hours)
The ability to efficiently work with big datasets and extract valuable information is an indispensable tool for every aspiring data scientist. When working with a small amount of data, we often don’t realize how slow code execution can be. This course will build on your knowledge of Python and the pandas library and introduce you to efficient built-in pandas functions to perform tasks faster. Pandas’ built-in functions allow you to tackle the simplest tasks, like targeting specific entries and features from the data, to the most complex tasks, like applying functions on groups of entries, much faster than Python's usual methods. By the end of this course, you will be able to apply a function to data based on a feature value, iterate through big datasets rapidly, and manipulate data belonging to different groups efficiently. You will apply these methods on a variety of real-world datasets, such as poker hands or restaurant tips.

### Selecting columns and rows efficiently
This chapter will give you an overview of why efficient code matters and selecting specific and random rows and columns efficiently.

## [Improving Your Data Visualizations in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/improving-your-data-visualizations-in-python) (4 hours)
Great data visualization is the cornerstone of impactful data science. Visualization helps you to both find insight in your data and share those insights with your audience. Everyone learns how to make a basic scatter plot or bar chart on their journey to becoming a data scientist, but the true potential of data visualization is realized when you take a step back and think about what, why, and how you are visualizing your data. In this course you will learn how to construct compelling and attractive visualizations that help you communicate the results of your analyses efficiently and effectively. We will cover comparing data, the ins and outs of color, showing uncertainty, and how to build the right visualization for your given audience through the investigation of a datasets on air pollution around the US and farmer's markets. We will finish the course by examining open-access farmers market data to build a polished and impactful visual report.

### Highlighting your data
How do you show all of your data while making sure that viewers don't miss an important point or points? Here we discuss how to guide your viewer through the data with color-based highlights and text. We also introduce a dataset on common pollutant values across the United States.

### Showing uncertainty
Uncertainty occurs everywhere in data science, but it's frequently left out of visualizations where it should be included. Here, we review what a confidence interval is and how to visualize them for both single estimates and continuous functions. Additionally, we discuss the bootstrap resampling technique for assessing uncertainty and how to visualize it properly.

## [Exploratory Data Analysis in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-python) (4 hours)
How do we get from data to answers?  Exploratory data analysis is a process for exploring datasets, answering questions, and visualizing results.  This course presents the tools you need to clean and validate data, to visualize distributions and relationships between variables, and to use regression models to predict and explain.  You'll explore data related to demographics and health, including the National Survey of Family Growth and the General Social Survey.  But the methods you learn apply to all areas of science, engineering, and business. You'll use Pandas, a powerful library for working with data, and other core Python libraries including NumPy and SciPy, StatsModels for regression, and Matplotlib for visualization.  With these tools and skills, you will be prepared to work with real data, make discoveries, and present compelling results.

### Read, clean, and validate
The first step of almost any data project is to read the data, check for errors and special cases, and prepare data for analysis. This is exactly what you'll do in this chapter, while working with a dataset obtained from the National Survey of Family Growth.
