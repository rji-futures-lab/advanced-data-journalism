## Course objective

The goal of this class is to teach students how to collect, manage, analyze and otherwise interact with data in the context of journalism practice. The primary tool students will learn and use is the Python programming language. Students will demonstrate:

- Fluency with Python's syntax
- Capability in using Python's standard library
- Capability in using several popular third-party libraries (e.g., `pandas`)
- Familiarity with quantitative reporting methods
- Familiarity with basic web technologies (e.g., HTTP, HTML and CSS)
- Capability in bootstrapping/managing Python project environments

Students also will produce a project requiring the acquisition and analysis of data and will report and write a story for publication. 

At the end of the semester, students will have been taught many of the skills required to do advanced data journalism in a newsroom environment.

## Course outline

Class will meet from 8:30 to 9:45 a.m. each Monday and Wednesday in 214 Lee Hills Hall. Most lectures will be delivered via the internet (and occasionally in person) by Chase Davis, innovations editor of the Minneapolis *Star Tribune.* Guest lecturers from the industry may will make periodic appearances. Some classes also will be taught by James and Mike. Class meetings will be spent reviewing coding concepts and lessons and applying them via exercises.

**Students should bring their laptops to all class sessions.**

The class will be built around a series of sequential modules that relate to and build off each other. These modules will cover the following topics (roughly) in this order. The list of assignnents is not inclusive; additional assignments will be introduced in the course of the semester:

- Python basics
- Jupyter Notebook and `pandas`
- Data analysis
- Data visualization
- Bootstrapping a Python environment
- Data cleaning/scraping
- Developing web apps

Because this learning relies on step-by-step progression, and because of the technical challenges posed by the nature of the material, it’s essential that students attend and participate in all classes and complete all assignments so they don’t fall behind.

There is no textbook for this class; links to relevant readings will be shared with students.

## Grading

Grading will be based on the following components:

• Assignments: 60 percent

• Data story project: 25 percent

• Class participation, engagement and attendance: 15 percent

There is no midterm or final exam for this course.

## Data story project

The data story project will represent the culmination of a variety of skills learned in this class and others. A successful project will consist of a well-reported data story on a relevant topic of local interest. Students will identify the topic and the appropriate data set, obtain the data, clean and analyze it, then write a publishable story about it. Discussion of the final project will begin early in the semester. Students will pitch ideas and report on their progress through regular, periodic memos. We’ll follow this schedule: 

* Story pitches due Feb. 10 (the fourth Monday) — submit a proposal, including details on your data (no more than one page).
* Pitch feedback returned by Feb. 17 (the fifth Monday)
* Draft due by Mar. 16 (the ninth Monday)
* Final drafts due Apr. 20 (the 13th Monday)

This process will be discussed in detail during the first weeks of class.

## Graduate assignment

Graduate students will be given an additional assignment to earn graduate credit for this course. This is in addition to the other assignments required of all students in the course. The graduate assignment will consist of researching and interviewing a leading industry practitioner about a particular project. Students will write a paper based on their interview and research, and will introduce the project and discuss the work before the class in the latter half of the semester. Successfully completing the graduate assignment is a stipulation for passing the course. A grade of C or better is required, even if all other course work is completed satisfactorily.

Grad students should discuss this assignment individually with James or Mike and obtain approval before beginning work on the assignment no later than Feb. 17 (the fifth Monday). Completed assignments are due Apr. 6 (the 11th Monday).

## Prerequisite

Completion of the computer-assisted reporting class is required.

## Attendance and punctuality  
Although it may be possible to observe some portions of the lectures remotely, students are expected to attend class. Not all lectures are taught over the web, and the lecture schedule is subject to change at any time. Students who fail to attend class will miss receiving important information from instructors, as well as missing in-class lessons completely. Furthermore, because it takes time to log into virtual meeting rooms, students are asked to be punctual. Showing up late and then having to log in can disrupt and delay presentations, and is unfair to students who are on time. Students with attendance or punctuality problems will pay a penalty in their participation grade.

## Core values and competencies

As a student of the Missouri School of Journalism, you are expected to be aware of certain core values and competencies. Specifically, the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC) requires that, irrespective of their particular specialization, all graduates should be able to:

• Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity;

• Think critically, creatively and independently;

• Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of information;

• Conduct research and evaluate information by methods appropriate to the communications professions in which they work;

• Apply basic numerical and statistical concepts;

• Apply current tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work, and to understand relevant aspects of the digital world.

## Academic honesty and integrity

Academic honesty is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful.

The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion.

Academic misconduct includes but is not limited to the following:

- Use of materials from another author without citation or attribution.

- Use of verbatim materials from another author without citation or attribution.

- Extensive use of materials from past assignments without permission of your instructor.

- Extensive use of materials from assignments in other classes without permission of your instructor.

- Extensive use of materials from work in a University media organization or external media organization without permission of your instructor.

- Fabricating information in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.

- Fabricating sources in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.

- Fabricating quotes in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.

- Lack of full disclosure or permission from editors when controversial reportorial techniques, such as going undercover to get news, are used.

When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting or collaboration, consult with your instructor. For closed-book exams and exercises, academic misconduct includes conferring with other class members, copying or reading someone else's test and using notes and materials without prior permission of the instructor. For open-book exams and exercises, academic misconduct includes copying or reading someone else's work.

## Classroom Misconduct

Classroom misconduct is defined by the [University of Missouri’s collected rules](https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.010_standard_of_conduct) and regulations are also outlined in the [M-Book Student Code of Conduct.](http://mbook.missouri.edu/)

Classroom misconduct can include obstruction or disruption of teaching, such as late arrival or early departure or failure to turn off mobile devices unless otherwise instructed.

Classroom misconduct can also include misuse of computing resources, harassment, bullying, physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.

## Dishonesty and Misconduct Reporting Procedures

MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic dishonesty or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct must be reported to [MU’s Office of Student Accountability & Support](https://accountability.missouri.edu/). Allegations of academic misconduct must be reported to [MU’s Office of Academic Integrity.](https://oai.missouri.edu/)

## Professional Standards and Ethics

The School of Journalism is committed to the highest standards of academic and professional ethics and expects its students to adhere to those standards. Students should be familiar with the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists and adhere to its restrictions. Students are expected to observe strict honesty in academic programs and as representatives of school-related media. Should any student be guilty of plagiarism, falsification, misrepresentation or other forms of dishonesty in any assigned work, that student may be subject to a failing grade from the instructor and such disciplinary action as may be necessary under University regulations.

## Copyright in course materials
The materials you encounter in your coursework at Mizzou is subject to many different types of copyright protection, depending on the author as well as how it is used. In a single course you may encounter materials created by your instructor, an article that is shared with you in an extemporaneous way under the [Teach Act ](http://libraryguides.missouri.edu/c.php?g=28158&p=173521), and materials such as course packets where each copy includes a royalty payment to the author. As a student, you are responsible for how you use course materials and must ensure that the rights of copyright holders are not violated by sharing them, posting materials online, etc.  
  
## Student work and copyright
Just like materials created by your instructor are protected by copyright, the things you create as a student are owned by you. For example, if your instructor uses TurnItIn to check for plagiarism in student papers, the University has an agreement with TurnItIn so that no papers are shared with that company and are only used to cross-reference.

## Audio and video recordings of classes
University of Missouri System Executive Order No. 38 lays out principles regarding the sanctity of classroom discussions at the university. The policy is described fully in Section 200.015 of the Collected Rules and Regulations. In this class, students may make audio or video recordings of course activity unless specifically prohibited by the faculty member. However, the redistribution of audio or video recordings of statements or comments from the course to individuals who are not students in the course is prohibited without the express permission of the faculty member and of any students who are recorded. Students found to have violated this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of [section 200.020](http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.020_rules_of_procedures_in_student_conduct_matters) of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri pertaining to student conduct matters.

## Religious holidays
Students are excused for recognized religious holidays. Let your instructor know in advance if you have a conflict.

## FERPA  
The University of Missouri maintains educational records of students in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA). Related topics include privacy policies at MU, display of student directory information and details about how MU manages FERPA-protected information. 

## University of Missouri Notice of Nondiscrimination
